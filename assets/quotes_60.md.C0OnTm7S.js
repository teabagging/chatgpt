After 10 minutes, Vitya realized he didn't have the house keys and that he would return home earlier than his mother, so he started to catch up with her by increasing his speed five times. How many minutes will it take from the moment he realized he needed to fetch the keys for Vitya to catch up with his mother?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where Vitya and his mom left home at the same time, walking in opposite directions with the same speed. Vitya is going to school, and his mom is going to work. After 10 minutes, Vitya realizes he forgot the house keys and decides to go back home. But he also realizes he'll return home earlier than his mom, so he decides to catch up with her by increasing his speed five times. The question is asking how many minutes it will take from the moment he realized he needed to fetch the keys for Vitya to catch up with his mother.Alright, let me break this down step by step. First, both Vitya and his mom started walking at the same time from the same point, but in opposite directions. They have the same speed, let's denote that speed as 'v'. So, for the first 10 minutes, they're moving away from each other.After 10 minutes, Vitya realizes he needs to go back home. But instead of just going back, he decides to catch up with his mom by increasing his speed five times. So, his new speed becomes 5v. I need to figure out how long it will take him to catch up with his mom from the moment he decides to do so.Let me visualize this scenario. Initially, both are moving away from home. After 10 minutes, Vitya is at a distance of v * 10 minutes from home, and his mom is also at a distance of v * 10 minutes from home, but in the opposite direction. So, the total distance between them at that point is 2 * v * 10 minutes.But wait, actually, since they are moving in opposite directions, the distance between them after 10 minutes is indeed the sum of the distances each has covered. So, that's correct: 2 * v * 10.However, when Vitya decides to go back, he's not just going back home; he's trying to catch up with his mom. So, he's changing direction and increasing his speed. So, from that point on, Vitya is moving towards his mom's direction, but at a higher speed.Wait, hold on. If Vitya is going back home, he's moving in the opposite direction of his initial path, which is towards his mom's direction. So, actually, he's moving towards his mom, but his mom is still moving away from home in the opposite direction. Hmm, so their relative motion is such that Vitya is moving towards his mom, but his mom is moving away from him.Wait, no. Let's clarify. Initially, both are moving away from home in opposite directions. After 10 minutes, Vitya is at position +10v (let's say positive direction is Vitya's direction), and his mom is at position -10v. Now, Vitya decides to go back home, so he starts moving in the negative direction, which is towards his mom's original direction. But his mom is still moving further away in the negative direction. So, actually, Vitya is moving towards his mom, but his mom is moving away from him.Wait, that might not be correct. Let me think again. If Vitya is moving towards home, which is the positive direction for him, but his mom is moving in the negative direction. So, actually, when Vitya turns around, he's moving in the negative direction, which is towards his mom's original position, but his mom is moving further in the negative direction.So, in effect, Vitya is moving towards his mom, who is moving away from him. So, their relative speed is the difference between their speeds because they're moving towards each other or away from each other?Wait, no. If Vitya is moving towards his mom, and his mom is moving away from him, then their relative speed is Vitya's speed plus his mom's speed because they are moving in opposite directions relative to each other.Wait, hold on. Let me think carefully. When two objects move towards each other, their relative speed is the sum of their speeds. When they move away from each other, their relative speed is the difference. But in this case, Vitya is moving towards his mom, who is moving away from him. So, their relative speed is the sum of Vitya's speed and his mom's speed because they are moving towards each other in terms of their relative motion.Wait, no, actually, if Vitya is moving towards his mom, and his mom is moving away from him, then their relative speed is Vitya's speed minus his mom's speed. Because if Vitya is moving faster towards his mom, he can catch up.Wait, maybe I should model this with equations.Let me denote:- Let the speed of Vitya and his mom initially be v (same speed).- After 10 minutes, Vitya turns around and starts moving back towards home at a speed of 5v.Wait, hold on. The problem says he increases his speed five times. So, does that mean his new speed is 5v or v + 5v = 6v? Hmm, the wording says \\"increasing his speed five times,\\" which usually means multiplying by five, so 5v. So, his new speed is 5v.But wait, when he turns around, is he moving towards home or towards his mom? Wait, he's going back home, which is in the opposite direction of where he was initially going. So, he's moving back towards home, which is in the direction opposite to his initial path. But his mom is moving away from home in the opposite direction. So, actually, Vitya is moving towards home, and his mom is moving away from home. So, their paths are diverging.Wait, that can't be. If Vitya is moving towards home, and his mom is moving away from home, then they are moving towards each other in the sense that Vitya is coming back, and his mom is going further away. So, their separation is increasing? Wait, no, because Vitya is moving towards home, which is the same direction as his mom is moving away from.Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to assign coordinates.Let me set home as the origin, 0. Let's say Vitya is moving in the positive direction towards school, and his mom is moving in the negative direction towards work.So, after 10 minutes, Vitya is at position +10v, and his mom is at position -10v.Now, Vitya realizes he needs to go back home, so he starts moving in the negative direction (towards home) at a speed of 5v.But his mom is still moving in the negative direction at speed v.So, from the moment Vitya turns around, both Vitya and his mom are moving in the negative direction, but Vitya is moving faster (5v) than his mom (v). So, Vitya is catching up to his mom from behind.So, the distance between them at the moment Vitya turns around is the distance between +10v and -10v, which is 20v.Wait, no. Wait, at the moment Vitya turns around, Vitya is at +10v, and his mom is at -10v. So, the distance between them is 20v.But now, Vitya is moving towards the negative direction at 5v, and his mom is moving further in the negative direction at v. So, their relative speed is Vitya's speed minus his mom's speed because they are moving in the same direction.So, relative speed = 5v - v = 4v.Therefore, the time it takes for Vitya to catch up to his mom is the distance between them divided by their relative speed.So, time = distance / relative speed = 20v / 4v = 5 minutes.Wait, so it would take 5 minutes from the moment he realizes he needs to fetch the keys.But let me verify this because I might have messed up the direction.Alternatively, let's model their positions as functions of time.Let t be the time elapsed since Vitya turned around.Vitya's position as a function of t: He was at +10v at t=0, and then he starts moving in the negative direction at 5v. So, his position is 10v - 5v*t.His mom's position as a function of t: She was at -10v at t=0, and she continues moving in the negative direction at v. So, her position is -10v - v*t.We need to find t when their positions are equal:10v - 5v*t = -10v - v*tLet's solve for t:10v - 5v*t = -10v - v*tBring all terms to one side:10v + 10v -5v*t + v*t = 020v -4v*t = 020v = 4v*tDivide both sides by 4v:5 = tSo, t = 5 minutes.So, yes, it takes 5 minutes from the moment he realizes he needs to fetch the keys for Vitya to catch up with his mother.But wait, let me think again. Is the distance between them 20v? Because Vitya is at +10v and his mom is at -10v, so the distance is 20v. Then, since Vitya is moving towards her at 5v, and she is moving away at v, the relative speed is 5v - v = 4v. So, time is 20v / 4v = 5 minutes. That seems consistent.Alternatively, if I think about how much distance Vitya needs to cover to catch up. He needs to cover the distance between them, which is 20v, but since he's moving towards her and she's moving away, the effective speed is 4v, so time is 5 minutes.Yes, that seems correct.Wait, but another way to think about it is, how much distance is Vitya covering relative to his mom.From the moment he turns around, Vitya is moving at 5v towards home, while his mom is moving at v away from home. So, relative to his mom, Vitya is approaching her at a speed of 5v + v = 6v? Wait, no, that's if they were moving towards each other. But in this case, they are moving in the same direction, so it's 5v - v = 4v.Wait, so relative speed is 4v, so time is 20v / 4v = 5 minutes. So, same result.Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of distance covered by each.In t minutes after turning around, Vitya covers 5v*t distance towards home, and his mom covers v*t distance away from home. But the initial distance between them was 20v. So, the distance Vitya needs to cover to catch up is 20v, but since his mom is moving away, the distance he needs to cover is 20v + v*t.Wait, no, that might complicate things.Alternatively, since Vitya is moving towards home and his mom is moving away from home, the distance between them is decreasing at a rate of 5v - v = 4v. So, time is 20v / 4v = 5 minutes.Yes, that seems consistent.So, I think the answer is 5 minutes.**Final Answer**It will take Vitya boxed{5} minutes to catch up with his mother."},{"question":"Given the function f(x)=x(x-c)^{2} has a local minimum at x=1, the value of the real number c is ________.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here: Given the function ( f(x) = x(x - c)^2 ) has a local minimum at ( x = 1 ). I need to find the value of the real number ( c ). Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that to find local minima or maxima, we usually take the derivative of the function and set it equal to zero. So, maybe I should start by finding the first derivative of ( f(x) ).The function is ( f(x) = x(x - c)^2 ). To find the derivative, I can use the product rule. The product rule states that if you have a function ( u(x)v(x) ), its derivative is ( u'(x)v(x) + u(x)v'(x) ). So, in this case, let me let ( u(x) = x ) and ( v(x) = (x - c)^2 ).Calculating the derivatives of ( u(x) ) and ( v(x) ):- ( u'(x) = 1 ) because the derivative of ( x ) with respect to ( x ) is 1.- ( v(x) = (x - c)^2 ), so ( v'(x) = 2(x - c) ) by the chain rule.Now, applying the product rule:( f'(x) = u'(x)v(x) + u(x)v'(x) = 1 cdot (x - c)^2 + x cdot 2(x - c) ).Simplify that:( f'(x) = (x - c)^2 + 2x(x - c) ).Hmm, maybe I can factor out ( (x - c) ) from both terms:( f'(x) = (x - c)[(x - c) + 2x] ).Simplify inside the brackets:( (x - c) + 2x = 3x - c ).So, the derivative simplifies to:( f'(x) = (x - c)(3x - c) ).Okay, so that's the first derivative. Now, since we're told that there's a local minimum at ( x = 1 ), that means that ( x = 1 ) is a critical point. So, ( f'(1) = 0 ).Let me plug ( x = 1 ) into the derivative:( f'(1) = (1 - c)(3(1) - c) = (1 - c)(3 - c) ).Set this equal to zero because it's a critical point:( (1 - c)(3 - c) = 0 ).So, either ( 1 - c = 0 ) or ( 3 - c = 0 ). That gives us two possible solutions:1. ( c = 1 )2. ( c = 3 )Hmm, so ( c ) could be either 1 or 3. But wait, we need to determine which one gives a local minimum at ( x = 1 ). Because sometimes, critical points can be maxima or saddle points, so we need to check whether ( x = 1 ) is indeed a minimum.To do that, I can use the second derivative test. Let me find the second derivative ( f''(x) ).Starting from the first derivative:( f'(x) = (x - c)(3x - c) ).Let me expand this before taking the derivative again. Multiply it out:( f'(x) = (x - c)(3x - c) = 3x^2 - cx - 3cx + c^2 = 3x^2 - 4cx + c^2 ).Now, take the derivative of this to get ( f''(x) ):( f''(x) = 6x - 4c ).Okay, so the second derivative is ( 6x - 4c ). Now, evaluate this at ( x = 1 ):( f''(1) = 6(1) - 4c = 6 - 4c ).For ( x = 1 ) to be a local minimum, the second derivative must be positive. So, we require:( 6 - 4c > 0 ).Solving for ( c ):( 6 > 4c )Divide both sides by 4:( frac{6}{4} > c )Simplify:( frac{3}{2} > c ) or ( c < frac{3}{2} ).So, ( c ) must be less than ( frac{3}{2} ). Now, let's look back at our two possible values for ( c ): 1 and 3.- If ( c = 1 ), then ( 1 < frac{3}{2} ), which satisfies the condition.- If ( c = 3 ), then ( 3 > frac{3}{2} ), which does not satisfy the condition.Therefore, ( c = 1 ) is the value that makes ( x = 1 ) a local minimum.Wait, hold on a second. Let me double-check. Because sometimes, when you have multiple critical points, you have to ensure that the point you're evaluating is indeed the one with the minimum.Alternatively, maybe I can test the intervals around ( x = 1 ) to see if the function changes from decreasing to increasing, which would indicate a minimum.But since we already used the second derivative test, which is more straightforward, and it tells us that ( c = 1 ) is the correct value because ( c = 3 ) would make the second derivative negative at ( x = 1 ), implying a local maximum.Let me confirm this. If ( c = 3 ), then ( f''(1) = 6 - 4(3) = 6 - 12 = -6 ), which is negative, so that would be a local maximum, not a minimum. So, yeah, ( c = 3 ) is out.Therefore, the correct value is ( c = 1 ).But wait, let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the derivative or the second derivative.Original function: ( f(x) = x(x - c)^2 ).First derivative: ( f'(x) = (x - c)^2 + 2x(x - c) ). Let me expand that:( (x - c)^2 = x^2 - 2cx + c^2 )( 2x(x - c) = 2x^2 - 2cx )Add them together:( x^2 - 2cx + c^2 + 2x^2 - 2cx = 3x^2 - 4cx + c^2 ). That's correct.Second derivative: ( f''(x) = 6x - 4c ). That's correct.So, plugging in ( x = 1 ):( f''(1) = 6 - 4c ). So, if ( c = 1 ), ( f''(1) = 6 - 4 = 2 > 0 ), which is a minimum.If ( c = 3 ), ( f''(1) = 6 - 12 = -6 < 0 ), which is a maximum.Therefore, yes, ( c = 1 ) is the correct answer.Just to be thorough, let me also check the behavior of the function around ( x = 1 ) when ( c = 1 ).So, if ( c = 1 ), the function becomes ( f(x) = x(x - 1)^2 ).Let me compute ( f(0) = 0 times (-1)^2 = 0 ).( f(1) = 1 times 0^2 = 0 ).( f(2) = 2 times 1^2 = 2 ).So, moving from left to right around ( x = 1 ):- At ( x = 0 ), the function is 0.- At ( x = 1 ), it's also 0.- At ( x = 2 ), it's 2.But wait, that doesn't seem to show a minimum. Maybe I need to pick points closer to 1.Let me try ( x = 0.5 ):( f(0.5) = 0.5 times (-0.5)^2 = 0.5 times 0.25 = 0.125 ).( x = 1 ): 0.( x = 1.5 ): ( 1.5 times (0.5)^2 = 1.5 times 0.25 = 0.375 ).Hmm, so from ( x = 0.5 ) to ( x = 1 ), the function goes from 0.125 to 0, which is decreasing.From ( x = 1 ) to ( x = 1.5 ), it goes from 0 to 0.375, which is increasing.So, it's decreasing before 1 and increasing after 1, which means ( x = 1 ) is indeed a local minimum. That checks out.If I had ( c = 3 ), let's see what happens.Function becomes ( f(x) = x(x - 3)^2 ).Compute ( f(1) = 1 times (-2)^2 = 4 ).Compute ( f(0) = 0 times 9 = 0 ).Compute ( f(2) = 2 times 1 = 2 ).Compute ( f(4) = 4 times 1 = 4 ).Wait, so at ( x = 1 ), it's 4. Let's check around ( x = 1 ):( x = 0.5 ): ( 0.5 times (-2.5)^2 = 0.5 times 6.25 = 3.125 ).( x = 1 ): 4.( x = 1.5 ): ( 1.5 times (-1.5)^2 = 1.5 times 2.25 = 3.375 ).So, moving from ( x = 0.5 ) to ( x = 1 ), the function goes from 3.125 to 4, which is increasing.From ( x = 1 ) to ( x = 1.5 ), it goes from 4 to 3.375, which is decreasing.Therefore, at ( x = 1 ), the function changes from increasing to decreasing, which means it's a local maximum when ( c = 3 ). So, that confirms our earlier conclusion.Therefore, the correct value is ( c = 1 ).I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. I double-checked both possibilities for ( c ), used the second derivative test, and even tested points around ( x = 1 ) to confirm the behavior of the function. So, yeah, ( c = 1 ) is the answer.**Final Answer**The value of ( c ) is boxed{1}."},{"question":"Given that the central angle of a regular polygon is 45^{circ} and the side length is 5, then the perimeter of this regular polygon is ____.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here: a regular polygon has a central angle of 45 degrees and a side length of 5. I need to find the perimeter. Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that in a regular polygon, all sides are equal and all central angles are equal. The central angle is the angle subtended at the center of the polygon by one of its sides. So, if the central angle is 45 degrees, that should help me figure out how many sides the polygon has.I recall that the sum of all central angles in a polygon is 360 degrees. Since it's regular, each central angle is equal. So, if each central angle is 45 degrees, the number of sides should be 360 divided by 45. Let me write that down:Number of sides, n = 360¬∞ / central angle = 360¬∞ / 45¬∞ = 8.Oh, so it's an octagon. That makes sense because an octagon has 8 sides, and each central angle is 45 degrees. Cool, so now I know it's a regular octagon with each side length of 5.Now, the perimeter is just the number of sides multiplied by the length of each side. Since each side is 5 and there are 8 sides, the perimeter should be 8 * 5. Let me calculate that:Perimeter = n * side length = 8 * 5 = 40.Wait, that seems straightforward. But let me double-check if I did everything correctly. Did I make any wrong assumptions?I assumed that the central angle is 45 degrees, so n = 360 / 45 = 8. That seems right. Then, perimeter is n times side length, which is 8*5=40. Hmm, that seems correct.Is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe using the formula for the side length in terms of the radius or something? Let me think.I know that the side length of a regular polygon can be expressed using the formula:s = 2 * R * sin(œÄ/n),where s is the side length, R is the radius (distance from center to a vertex), and n is the number of sides.But in this problem, I don't know R. However, I do know the central angle, which is 45 degrees. Wait, the central angle is related to the radius as well. Maybe I can find R first?Alternatively, maybe I can use the formula for the perimeter in terms of the central angle. Let me see.Wait, actually, since I already found that n=8, and each side is 5, the perimeter is just 8*5=40. I think that's solid. Maybe I don't need to complicate it further.But just to make sure, let me recall that in a regular polygon, the central angle is given by 360/n, so if central angle is 45, n=8. So, that's consistent.Therefore, the perimeter is 8*5=40. I think that's the answer.**Final Answer**The perimeter of the regular polygon is boxed{40}."},{"question":"Let set A = {-1, 1, 3}, and set B = {a + 2, a^2 + 4}. If A cap B = {3}, then the value of the real number a is boxed{1}.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where set A is {-1, 1, 3} and set B is {a + 2, a¬≤ + 4}. It says that the intersection of A and B is {3}, which means that 3 is the only element common to both sets. My goal is to find the real number a that satisfies this condition.First, let me make sure I understand what the intersection means. The intersection of two sets contains all elements that are in both sets. So, since A ‚à© B = {3}, that tells me that 3 must be in both A and B. Looking at set A, I can see that 3 is indeed an element. Therefore, 3 must also be in set B.Set B has two elements: a + 2 and a¬≤ + 4. So, either a + 2 equals 3 or a¬≤ + 4 equals 3. It could be one or both, but since the intersection is only {3}, that means the other element in B should not be in A. So, if one of them is 3, the other should not be -1, 1, or 3.Let me write down the possibilities:Case 1: a + 2 = 3Case 2: a¬≤ + 4 = 3I need to solve both equations and check if the other element in B is not in A.Starting with Case 1: a + 2 = 3Subtract 2 from both sides: a = 1So, if a is 1, then let's find the other element in B. The elements of B are a + 2 and a¬≤ + 4. If a = 1, then a + 2 = 3 and a¬≤ + 4 = 1 + 4 = 5. So, set B becomes {3, 5}.Now, checking if 5 is in set A. Set A is {-1, 1, 3}, so 5 is not in A. That means the intersection is only {3}, which satisfies the given condition. So, a = 1 is a possible solution.Now, let's check Case 2: a¬≤ + 4 = 3Subtract 4 from both sides: a¬≤ = -1Hmm, a¬≤ = -1. But since a is a real number, the square of a real number can't be negative. So, this equation has no real solutions. Therefore, Case 2 doesn't give us any valid a.So, the only possible value for a is 1.Wait, but just to make sure I didn't miss anything, let me think again. If a + 2 = 3, then a = 1, which gives B as {3, 5}, which is fine because 5 isn't in A. If a¬≤ + 4 = 3, that would require a to be imaginary, which isn't allowed here. So, yeah, a must be 1.I don't think there are any other cases because set B only has two elements, and we've checked both possibilities. So, I'm confident that a = 1 is the correct answer.**Final Answer**The value of the real number ( a ) is boxed{1}."},{"question":"Given a circle C: (x-3)^{2}+(y-4)^{2}=1, and points A(-1,0), B(1,0), let P be a moving point on the circle, then the maximum and minimum values of d=|PA|^{2}+|PB|^{2} are ______ and ______ respectively.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: there's a circle C defined by the equation (x - 3)^2 + (y - 4)^2 = 1. Points A and B are given as (-1, 0) and (1, 0) respectively. Point P is moving on the circle, and I need to find the maximum and minimum values of d, where d is the sum of the squares of the distances from P to A and P to B. So, d = |PA|^2 + |PB|^2.Hmm, let me try to visualize this. The circle is centered at (3, 4) with a radius of 1. Points A and B are on the x-axis, symmetric about the origin. So, A is at (-1, 0) and B is at (1, 0). Point P is somewhere on the circumference of the circle, and I need to compute d for all such P and find its maximum and minimum.I remember that the square of the distance between two points can be expressed using coordinates. So, if P is (x, y), then |PA|^2 is (x + 1)^2 + (y - 0)^2, which simplifies to (x + 1)^2 + y^2. Similarly, |PB|^2 is (x - 1)^2 + y^2. Therefore, d = (x + 1)^2 + y^2 + (x - 1)^2 + y^2.Let me compute that:d = (x + 1)^2 + y^2 + (x - 1)^2 + y^2= [ (x^2 + 2x + 1) + y^2 ] + [ (x^2 - 2x + 1) + y^2 ]= x^2 + 2x + 1 + y^2 + x^2 - 2x + 1 + y^2= 2x^2 + 2y^2 + 2So, d simplifies to 2x^2 + 2y^2 + 2.Wait, that seems manageable. So, d = 2x^2 + 2y^2 + 2. Maybe I can factor out the 2:d = 2(x^2 + y^2) + 2.Hmm, so if I can find the maximum and minimum of x^2 + y^2 for points P on the circle C, then I can just multiply by 2 and add 2 to get d.So, let me denote S = x^2 + y^2. Then, d = 2S + 2. Therefore, I need to find the maximum and minimum of S on the circle C.But wait, S is the square of the distance from the origin to the point P(x, y). So, S = |OP|^2, where O is the origin (0,0). So, I need to find the maximum and minimum of |OP|^2 as P moves on circle C.Alternatively, since |OP|^2 is a continuous function on a compact set (the circle), it will attain its maximum and minimum.I remember that the maximum and minimum of |OP| on a circle can be found by considering the distance from the origin to the center of the circle, and then adding or subtracting the radius.Wait, let me recall the formula: For a circle with center (h, k) and radius r, the maximum distance from a point on the circle to the origin is sqrt(h^2 + k^2) + r, and the minimum is sqrt(h^2 + k^2) - r. So, the square of these distances would be (sqrt(h^2 + k^2) ¬± r)^2.But in this case, S is |OP|^2, so the maximum S is (sqrt(h^2 + k^2) + r)^2 and the minimum S is (sqrt(h^2 + k^2) - r)^2.So, let me compute sqrt(h^2 + k^2) for the center (3,4):sqrt(3^2 + 4^2) = sqrt(9 + 16) = sqrt(25) = 5.So, the distance from the origin to the center is 5, and the radius of the circle is 1.Therefore, the maximum |OP| is 5 + 1 = 6, so maximum S is 6^2 = 36.The minimum |OP| is 5 - 1 = 4, so minimum S is 4^2 = 16.Therefore, S ranges from 16 to 36.Therefore, d = 2S + 2 ranges from 2*16 + 2 = 34 to 2*36 + 2 = 74.Wait, so the minimum value of d is 34 and the maximum is 74.But let me double-check this because sometimes when dealing with squared distances, there might be a different approach.Alternatively, I can parametrize point P on the circle. Since the circle is (x - 3)^2 + (y - 4)^2 = 1, I can write P as (3 + cosŒ∏, 4 + sinŒ∏), where Œ∏ is the parameter varying from 0 to 2œÄ.Then, compute d = |PA|^2 + |PB|^2.Let me compute |PA|^2:PA^2 = (x + 1)^2 + y^2= (3 + cosŒ∏ + 1)^2 + (4 + sinŒ∏)^2= (4 + cosŒ∏)^2 + (4 + sinŒ∏)^2Similarly, |PB|^2:PB^2 = (x - 1)^2 + y^2= (3 + cosŒ∏ - 1)^2 + (4 + sinŒ∏)^2= (2 + cosŒ∏)^2 + (4 + sinŒ∏)^2Therefore, d = PA^2 + PB^2 = [ (4 + cosŒ∏)^2 + (4 + sinŒ∏)^2 ] + [ (2 + cosŒ∏)^2 + (4 + sinŒ∏)^2 ]Let me compute each term:First, expand (4 + cosŒ∏)^2:= 16 + 8cosŒ∏ + cos¬≤Œ∏(4 + sinŒ∏)^2:= 16 + 8sinŒ∏ + sin¬≤Œ∏Similarly, (2 + cosŒ∏)^2:= 4 + 4cosŒ∏ + cos¬≤Œ∏And the other term is same as before, (4 + sinŒ∏)^2 = 16 + 8sinŒ∏ + sin¬≤Œ∏.So, putting it all together:d = [16 + 8cosŒ∏ + cos¬≤Œ∏ + 16 + 8sinŒ∏ + sin¬≤Œ∏] + [4 + 4cosŒ∏ + cos¬≤Œ∏ + 16 + 8sinŒ∏ + sin¬≤Œ∏]Let me compute each bracket:First bracket: 16 + 16 = 32; 8cosŒ∏ + 8sinŒ∏; cos¬≤Œ∏ + sin¬≤Œ∏ = 1.So, first bracket: 32 + 8cosŒ∏ + 8sinŒ∏ + 1 = 33 + 8cosŒ∏ + 8sinŒ∏.Second bracket: 4 + 16 = 20; 4cosŒ∏ + 8sinŒ∏; cos¬≤Œ∏ + sin¬≤Œ∏ = 1.So, second bracket: 20 + 4cosŒ∏ + 8sinŒ∏ + 1 = 21 + 4cosŒ∏ + 8sinŒ∏.Therefore, d = (33 + 8cosŒ∏ + 8sinŒ∏) + (21 + 4cosŒ∏ + 8sinŒ∏) = 33 + 21 + (8cosŒ∏ + 4cosŒ∏) + (8sinŒ∏ + 8sinŒ∏) = 54 + 12cosŒ∏ + 16sinŒ∏.So, d = 54 + 12cosŒ∏ + 16sinŒ∏.Hmm, so now I have d expressed as 54 + 12cosŒ∏ + 16sinŒ∏. So, to find the maximum and minimum of d, I need to find the maximum and minimum of 12cosŒ∏ + 16sinŒ∏.I remember that expressions of the form A cosŒ∏ + B sinŒ∏ can be rewritten as C cos(Œ∏ - œÜ), where C = sqrt(A¬≤ + B¬≤) and tanœÜ = B/A.So, let me compute C:C = sqrt(12¬≤ + 16¬≤) = sqrt(144 + 256) = sqrt(400) = 20.So, 12cosŒ∏ + 16sinŒ∏ = 20 cos(Œ∏ - œÜ), where œÜ is such that cosœÜ = 12/20 = 3/5 and sinœÜ = 16/20 = 4/5.Therefore, 12cosŒ∏ + 16sinŒ∏ ranges between -20 and 20.Therefore, d = 54 + [12cosŒ∏ + 16sinŒ∏] ranges from 54 - 20 = 34 to 54 + 20 = 74.So, the minimum value of d is 34, and the maximum is 74.Wait, that's consistent with what I found earlier when I considered S = x¬≤ + y¬≤ and found that d = 2S + 2, with S ranging from 16 to 36, so d ranges from 34 to 74.Therefore, both methods give the same result, so I think that's correct.But just to be thorough, let me think about another approach. Maybe using vectors or coordinate geometry.Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for the sum of squares of distances from two points.Wait, I remember that for any point P, |PA|¬≤ + |PB|¬≤ can be expressed in terms of |PO|¬≤ and |AB|¬≤.Wait, let me recall the formula: For any point P, |PA|¬≤ + |PB|¬≤ = 2|PO|¬≤ + (|OA|¬≤ + |OB|¬≤)/2 or something like that? Hmm, maybe not exactly.Wait, actually, there's a formula that says |PA|¬≤ + |PB|¬≤ = 2|PM|¬≤ + (|MA|¬≤ + |MB|¬≤), where M is the midpoint of AB.Wait, let me check that.Yes, in general, for any two points A and B, and any point P, the following holds:|PA|¬≤ + |PB|¬≤ = 2|PM|¬≤ + (|MA|¬≤ + |MB|¬≤), where M is the midpoint of AB.So, in this case, points A(-1, 0) and B(1, 0). The midpoint M is ((-1 + 1)/2, (0 + 0)/2) = (0, 0). So, M is the origin.Therefore, |PA|¬≤ + |PB|¬≤ = 2|PO|¬≤ + (|MA|¬≤ + |MB|¬≤).But since M is the origin, |MA| is the distance from M to A, which is sqrt((-1 - 0)^2 + (0 - 0)^2) = 1. Similarly, |MB| is 1.Therefore, |PA|¬≤ + |PB|¬≤ = 2|PO|¬≤ + (1¬≤ + 1¬≤) = 2|PO|¬≤ + 2.Which is exactly what I had earlier: d = 2(x¬≤ + y¬≤) + 2.So, that's consistent. So, d = 2|PO|¬≤ + 2.Therefore, since |PO|¬≤ is the square of the distance from P to the origin, which, as I found earlier, ranges from 16 to 36 on the circle C. Therefore, d ranges from 2*16 + 2 = 34 to 2*36 + 2 = 74.So, that's another way to see it.Alternatively, maybe using calculus. Since d is a function of Œ∏, d(Œ∏) = 54 + 12cosŒ∏ + 16sinŒ∏. To find its maximum and minimum, take derivative with respect to Œ∏, set to zero.Compute derivative:d'(Œ∏) = -12 sinŒ∏ + 16 cosŒ∏.Set to zero:-12 sinŒ∏ + 16 cosŒ∏ = 0.So, 16 cosŒ∏ = 12 sinŒ∏.Divide both sides by cosŒ∏ (assuming cosŒ∏ ‚â† 0):16 = 12 tanŒ∏.Therefore, tanŒ∏ = 16/12 = 4/3.So, Œ∏ = arctan(4/3) or Œ∏ = arctan(4/3) + œÄ.So, these are the critical points.Compute d at Œ∏ = arctan(4/3):First, let me find sinŒ∏ and cosŒ∏.If tanŒ∏ = 4/3, then we can think of a right triangle with opposite side 4, adjacent side 3, hypotenuse 5.Therefore, sinŒ∏ = 4/5, cosŒ∏ = 3/5.Therefore, d = 54 + 12*(3/5) + 16*(4/5) = 54 + (36/5) + (64/5) = 54 + (100/5) = 54 + 20 = 74.Similarly, at Œ∏ = arctan(4/3) + œÄ, sinŒ∏ = -4/5, cosŒ∏ = -3/5.Therefore, d = 54 + 12*(-3/5) + 16*(-4/5) = 54 - (36/5) - (64/5) = 54 - (100/5) = 54 - 20 = 34.Therefore, the maximum value is 74 and the minimum is 34.So, that's another way to confirm.Alternatively, using Lagrange multipliers. Since we need to maximize and minimize d = 2x¬≤ + 2y¬≤ + 2 subject to the constraint (x - 3)^2 + (y - 4)^2 = 1.Set up the Lagrangian:L = 2x¬≤ + 2y¬≤ + 2 - Œª[(x - 3)^2 + (y - 4)^2 - 1]Take partial derivatives:‚àÇL/‚àÇx = 4x - Œª*2(x - 3) = 0‚àÇL/‚àÇy = 4y - Œª*2(y - 4) = 0‚àÇL/‚àÇŒª = -( (x - 3)^2 + (y - 4)^2 - 1 ) = 0So, equations:1) 4x - 2Œª(x - 3) = 02) 4y - 2Œª(y - 4) = 03) (x - 3)^2 + (y - 4)^2 = 1From equation 1:4x = 2Œª(x - 3)Divide both sides by 2:2x = Œª(x - 3)Similarly, equation 2:4y = 2Œª(y - 4)Divide by 2:2y = Œª(y - 4)So, from equation 1:Œª = 2x / (x - 3)From equation 2:Œª = 2y / (y - 4)Therefore, 2x / (x - 3) = 2y / (y - 4)Simplify:x / (x - 3) = y / (y - 4)Cross-multiplying:x(y - 4) = y(x - 3)Expand:xy - 4x = xy - 3ySubtract xy from both sides:-4x = -3yMultiply both sides by (-1):4x = 3yTherefore, y = (4/3)xSo, now we have y = (4/3)x. Let's plug this into the constraint equation (equation 3):(x - 3)^2 + (y - 4)^2 = 1Substitute y = (4/3)x:(x - 3)^2 + ( (4/3)x - 4 )^2 = 1Compute each term:(x - 3)^2 = x¬≤ - 6x + 9( (4/3)x - 4 )^2 = ( (4x/3 - 4) )^2 = (4x/3 - 12/3)^2 = ( (4x - 12)/3 )^2 = (4x - 12)^2 / 9 = (16x¬≤ - 96x + 144)/9Therefore, equation becomes:x¬≤ - 6x + 9 + (16x¬≤ - 96x + 144)/9 = 1Multiply both sides by 9 to eliminate denominator:9x¬≤ - 54x + 81 + 16x¬≤ - 96x + 144 = 9Combine like terms:(9x¬≤ + 16x¬≤) + (-54x - 96x) + (81 + 144) = 925x¬≤ - 150x + 225 = 9Subtract 9:25x¬≤ - 150x + 216 = 0Divide equation by GCD 1, so equation remains:25x¬≤ - 150x + 216 = 0Let me try to solve this quadratic equation.Compute discriminant D:D = (-150)^2 - 4*25*216 = 22500 - 21600 = 900So, sqrt(D) = 30Therefore, solutions:x = [150 ¬± 30]/(2*25) = [150 ¬± 30]/50So,x = (150 + 30)/50 = 180/50 = 18/5 = 3.6x = (150 - 30)/50 = 120/50 = 12/5 = 2.4Therefore, x = 3.6 or x = 2.4Since y = (4/3)x,For x = 3.6, y = (4/3)*3.6 = 4.8For x = 2.4, y = (4/3)*2.4 = 3.2So, the critical points are (3.6, 4.8) and (2.4, 3.2)Now, let's compute d at these points.First, for (3.6, 4.8):Compute d = 2x¬≤ + 2y¬≤ + 2x¬≤ = (3.6)^2 = 12.96y¬≤ = (4.8)^2 = 23.04So, d = 2*(12.96 + 23.04) + 2 = 2*(36) + 2 = 72 + 2 = 74Similarly, for (2.4, 3.2):x¬≤ = (2.4)^2 = 5.76y¬≤ = (3.2)^2 = 10.24So, d = 2*(5.76 + 10.24) + 2 = 2*(16) + 2 = 32 + 2 = 34Therefore, the maximum value is 74 and the minimum is 34.So, that's consistent with all the previous methods.Alternatively, another way is to note that the expression d = |PA|¬≤ + |PB|¬≤ can be related to the moment of inertia in physics, where A and B are points, and P is a particle moving on the circle. The moment of inertia would be the sum of the squared distances times mass, but in this case, masses are 1, so it's just the sum.But regardless, the mathematical approach is the same.Alternatively, using coordinate transformations. Since points A and B are symmetric about the origin, and the circle is centered at (3,4), maybe shifting the coordinate system could help, but I think the methods above are sufficient.So, in summary, through multiple approaches‚Äîparametrization, using the formula for sum of squared distances, calculus with Lagrange multipliers‚ÄîI arrived at the conclusion that the minimum value of d is 34 and the maximum is 74.**Final Answer**The maximum and minimum values of ( d ) are boxed{74} and boxed{34} respectively."},{"question":"Given the function f(x)=2cos x(sin x+cos x)-1.(I) Find the smallest positive period of the function f(x);(II) Find the sum of the maximum and minimum values of the function f(x) on the interval left[-dfrac{pi}{6},-dfrac{pi}{12}right].","answer":"Alright, so I have this function f(x) = 2 cos x (sin x + cos x) - 1, and I need to find its smallest positive period and then the sum of its maximum and minimum values on the interval [-œÄ/6, -œÄ/12]. Hmm, okay, let's take it step by step.Starting with part (I): Finding the smallest positive period of f(x). I remember that for trigonometric functions, the period is the length after which the function repeats itself. So, if I can rewrite f(x) in terms of sine and cosine functions with known periods, maybe I can figure out the period.Looking at f(x) = 2 cos x (sin x + cos x) - 1. Let me try to expand this expression first to simplify it. So, distribute the 2 cos x:f(x) = 2 cos x sin x + 2 cos¬≤ x - 1.Hmm, okay, now I have two terms: 2 cos x sin x and 2 cos¬≤ x, and then subtracting 1. I recall some trigonometric identities that might help here.First, 2 cos x sin x is equal to sin(2x). That's a standard identity: sin(2x) = 2 sin x cos x. So, that term simplifies to sin(2x).Next, the term 2 cos¬≤ x. There's an identity for cos¬≤ x as well: cos¬≤ x = (1 + cos(2x))/2. So, substituting that in, 2 cos¬≤ x becomes 2*(1 + cos(2x))/2, which simplifies to 1 + cos(2x).So, putting it all together, f(x) becomes:f(x) = sin(2x) + 1 + cos(2x) - 1.Wait, the +1 and -1 cancel each other out, so f(x) simplifies to:f(x) = sin(2x) + cos(2x).Okay, that's much simpler. Now, f(x) is expressed as sin(2x) + cos(2x). I need to find the period of this function.I know that both sin(2x) and cos(2x) have periods of œÄ, because the period of sin(kx) or cos(kx) is 2œÄ/k. Here, k is 2, so the period is œÄ. Since both terms have the same period, the sum should also have the same period, right? So, the period of f(x) is œÄ.But wait, just to be thorough, sometimes when you add two functions with the same period, the resulting function can have a smaller period if they are in phase or something. But in this case, sin(2x) and cos(2x) are phase-shifted versions of each other. Let me think.The function sin(2x) + cos(2x) can be written as a single sine or cosine function with a phase shift. Let me try that.Using the identity: a sin Œ∏ + b cos Œ∏ = ‚àö(a¬≤ + b¬≤) sin(Œ∏ + œÜ), where œÜ is the phase shift. Here, a = 1 and b = 1, so ‚àö(1 + 1) = ‚àö2. So, sin(2x) + cos(2x) = ‚àö2 sin(2x + œÜ). The phase shift œÜ can be found using tan œÜ = b/a = 1, so œÜ = œÄ/4.Therefore, f(x) = ‚àö2 sin(2x + œÄ/4). So, this is a sine function with amplitude ‚àö2, frequency 2, and phase shift œÄ/4. The period of this function is 2œÄ divided by the frequency, which is 2. So, period is œÄ.Therefore, the smallest positive period is œÄ. So, that's part (I) done.Moving on to part (II): Finding the sum of the maximum and minimum values of f(x) on the interval [-œÄ/6, -œÄ/12].First, let me recall that f(x) simplifies to ‚àö2 sin(2x + œÄ/4). So, it's a sine function with amplitude ‚àö2, which means its maximum value is ‚àö2 and minimum is -‚àö2. However, these extrema occur at specific points, and depending on the interval, the function might not reach these absolute extrema.So, I need to find the maximum and minimum values of f(x) on the interval [-œÄ/6, -œÄ/12]. Let's denote this interval as [a, b], where a = -œÄ/6 and b = -œÄ/12.To find the extrema on a closed interval, I can use calculus: find the critical points by taking the derivative, setting it equal to zero, and then evaluating the function at the critical points and endpoints.So, let's compute the derivative of f(x). Since f(x) = ‚àö2 sin(2x + œÄ/4), the derivative f‚Äô(x) is ‚àö2 * 2 cos(2x + œÄ/4) = 2‚àö2 cos(2x + œÄ/4).Set the derivative equal to zero to find critical points:2‚àö2 cos(2x + œÄ/4) = 0.Divide both sides by 2‚àö2:cos(2x + œÄ/4) = 0.So, 2x + œÄ/4 = œÄ/2 + kœÄ, where k is any integer.Solving for x:2x = œÄ/2 - œÄ/4 + kœÄ = œÄ/4 + kœÄ.So, x = œÄ/8 + kœÄ/2.Now, we need to find all x in the interval [-œÄ/6, -œÄ/12] such that x = œÄ/8 + kœÄ/2.Let me compute œÄ/8 ‚âà 0.3927, and œÄ/2 ‚âà 1.5708. So, let's see for different k:For k = -1: x = œÄ/8 - œÄ/2 = -3œÄ/8 ‚âà -1.1781, which is less than -œÄ/6 ‚âà -0.5236. So, not in the interval.For k = 0: x = œÄ/8 ‚âà 0.3927, which is greater than -œÄ/12 ‚âà -0.2618. So, not in the interval.For k = -2: x = œÄ/8 - œÄ = -7œÄ/8 ‚âà -2.7489, which is way outside the interval.Wait, so perhaps there are no critical points within the interval [-œÄ/6, -œÄ/12]. Hmm, that can't be right. Let me double-check.Wait, maybe I made a mistake in solving for x. Let me write it again.From cos(2x + œÄ/4) = 0,2x + œÄ/4 = œÄ/2 + kœÄSo, 2x = œÄ/2 - œÄ/4 + kœÄ = œÄ/4 + kœÄSo, x = œÄ/8 + kœÄ/2.So, for k = -1: x = œÄ/8 - œÄ/2 = -3œÄ/8 ‚âà -1.178, which is less than -œÄ/6 ‚âà -0.5236.For k = 0: x = œÄ/8 ‚âà 0.3927, which is greater than -œÄ/12 ‚âà -0.2618.So, indeed, in the interval [-œÄ/6, -œÄ/12], which is approximately [-0.5236, -0.2618], there are no critical points because the critical points are at x = -3œÄ/8 ‚âà -1.178 and x = œÄ/8 ‚âà 0.3927, which are outside the interval.Therefore, the extrema on the interval must occur at the endpoints.So, to find the maximum and minimum, I just need to evaluate f(x) at x = -œÄ/6 and x = -œÄ/12.So, let's compute f(-œÄ/6) and f(-œÄ/12).First, f(x) = ‚àö2 sin(2x + œÄ/4).Compute f(-œÄ/6):2*(-œÄ/6) + œÄ/4 = -œÄ/3 + œÄ/4.Convert to common denominator: -4œÄ/12 + 3œÄ/12 = (-4 + 3)œÄ/12 = -œÄ/12.So, f(-œÄ/6) = ‚àö2 sin(-œÄ/12).Similarly, f(-œÄ/12):2*(-œÄ/12) + œÄ/4 = -œÄ/6 + œÄ/4.Convert to common denominator: -2œÄ/12 + 3œÄ/12 = ( -2 + 3 )œÄ/12 = œÄ/12.So, f(-œÄ/12) = ‚àö2 sin(œÄ/12).Now, sin(-œÄ/12) = -sin(œÄ/12), so f(-œÄ/6) = ‚àö2*(-sin(œÄ/12)) = -‚àö2 sin(œÄ/12).Similarly, f(-œÄ/12) = ‚àö2 sin(œÄ/12).So, f(-œÄ/6) is negative, and f(-œÄ/12) is positive. Therefore, on the interval, the maximum value is f(-œÄ/12) = ‚àö2 sin(œÄ/12), and the minimum value is f(-œÄ/6) = -‚àö2 sin(œÄ/12).Therefore, the sum of the maximum and minimum is ‚àö2 sin(œÄ/12) + (-‚àö2 sin(œÄ/12)) = 0.Wait, that can't be right. If the maximum is positive and the minimum is negative, their sum is zero? Hmm, but let me think again.Wait, actually, the function is continuous on a closed interval, and since there are no critical points inside the interval, the extrema are indeed at the endpoints. So, if one endpoint is positive and the other is negative, then yes, their sum would be zero.But let me verify the calculations step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.First, f(x) = ‚àö2 sin(2x + œÄ/4). So, at x = -œÄ/6:2*(-œÄ/6) = -œÄ/3. So, 2x + œÄ/4 = -œÄ/3 + œÄ/4.Convert to twelfths: -4œÄ/12 + 3œÄ/12 = -œÄ/12. So, sin(-œÄ/12) = -sin(œÄ/12). So, f(-œÄ/6) = ‚àö2*(-sin(œÄ/12)).Similarly, at x = -œÄ/12:2*(-œÄ/12) = -œÄ/6. So, 2x + œÄ/4 = -œÄ/6 + œÄ/4.Convert to twelfths: -2œÄ/12 + 3œÄ/12 = œÄ/12. So, sin(œÄ/12). So, f(-œÄ/12) = ‚àö2 sin(œÄ/12).Therefore, the maximum is ‚àö2 sin(œÄ/12), the minimum is -‚àö2 sin(œÄ/12). So, their sum is zero.Wait, but is that possible? The function is symmetric around the midpoint of the interval? Hmm, maybe, but let's think about the function f(x) = ‚àö2 sin(2x + œÄ/4). It's a sine wave with period œÄ, so over an interval of length œÄ/12 - (-œÄ/6) = œÄ/12 + œÄ/6 = œÄ/4. So, the interval is œÄ/4 long, which is a quarter of the period. So, over a quarter period, the function goes from some point to another.But in this case, the function is evaluated at two points, and the sum is zero. Hmm.Alternatively, maybe I can compute sin(œÄ/12) numerically to check.œÄ/12 is 15 degrees, so sin(15¬∞) is (‚àö6 - ‚àö2)/4 ‚âà 0.2588.So, ‚àö2 sin(œÄ/12) ‚âà ‚àö2 * 0.2588 ‚âà 1.4142 * 0.2588 ‚âà 0.366.Similarly, -‚àö2 sin(œÄ/12) ‚âà -0.366.So, adding them together gives approximately 0.366 + (-0.366) = 0.So, yeah, it seems correct. The sum is zero.But wait, is that the case? Because sometimes, depending on the function, the maximum and minimum might not be symmetric. But in this case, since the function is a sine function, and the interval is symmetric around a certain point? Wait, no, the interval is from -œÄ/6 to -œÄ/12, which is not symmetric around any particular point.Wait, but the function is f(x) = ‚àö2 sin(2x + œÄ/4). Let me see if the interval is symmetric in terms of the argument of the sine function.Let me denote Œ∏ = 2x + œÄ/4. So, when x = -œÄ/6, Œ∏ = 2*(-œÄ/6) + œÄ/4 = -œÄ/3 + œÄ/4 = -œÄ/12.When x = -œÄ/12, Œ∏ = 2*(-œÄ/12) + œÄ/4 = -œÄ/6 + œÄ/4 = œÄ/12.So, Œ∏ goes from -œÄ/12 to œÄ/12. So, the argument of the sine function goes from -œÄ/12 to œÄ/12, which is symmetric around zero.Therefore, sin(Œ∏) is an odd function, so sin(-œÄ/12) = -sin(œÄ/12). Therefore, f(-œÄ/6) = ‚àö2 sin(-œÄ/12) = -‚àö2 sin(œÄ/12), and f(-œÄ/12) = ‚àö2 sin(œÄ/12). So, the function evaluated at these two points are negatives of each other, hence their sum is zero.Therefore, the sum of the maximum and minimum is zero.Wait, but just to make sure, is the function indeed symmetric in this interval? Because Œ∏ goes from -œÄ/12 to œÄ/12, which is symmetric around zero, so yes, the function f(x) = ‚àö2 sin(Œ∏) is symmetric in that sense.Therefore, the maximum is ‚àö2 sin(œÄ/12), the minimum is -‚àö2 sin(œÄ/12), so their sum is zero.Therefore, the answer for part (II) is 0.But let me just think again: is it possible that within the interval, the function reaches a higher maximum or a lower minimum? But since we checked that there are no critical points inside the interval, the extrema must be at the endpoints. So, yes, the maximum is at x = -œÄ/12, and the minimum is at x = -œÄ/6, and their sum is zero.Therefore, the final answers are:(I) The smallest positive period is œÄ.(II) The sum of the maximum and minimum values is 0.**Final Answer**(I) The smallest positive period is boxed{pi}.(II) The sum of the maximum and minimum values is boxed{0}."},{"question":"Tim does 100 tasks a day.

They want to buy a cake, but neither of them has enough money. If the cake costs 6 euros and Emily has an American five-dollar bill, how many euros does Berengere need to contribute to the cost of the cake if 1 euro = 1.25 USD?","answer":"First, I need to determine the total cost of the cake in euros, which is 6 euros.Emily has an American five-dollar bill. To find out how much this is in euros, I'll use the given exchange rate of 1 euro = 1.25 USD. By dividing Emily's 5 USD by the exchange rate (1.25), I can calculate the equivalent amount in euros. So, 5 USD divided by 1.25 equals 4 euros. This means Emily can contribute 4 euros towards the cost of the cake.

Let me break this down step by step. First, I notice that both the numerator and the denominator have products of cosines subtracted from each other. Maybe there's a trigonometric identity that can simplify these expressions.I remember that there's a product-to-sum identity for cosines:[cos A cos B = frac{1}{2} [cos(A + B) + cos(A - B)]]Yes, that might help. Let me apply this identity to both the numerator and the denominator.Starting with the numerator:[cos 67^{circ} cos 7^{circ} - cos 83^{circ} cos 23^{circ}]Applying the identity to each product:First term:[cos 67^{circ} cos 7^{circ} = frac{1}{2} [cos(67 + 7) + cos(67 - 7)] = frac{1}{2} [cos 74^{circ} + cos 60^{circ}]]Second term:[cos 83^{circ} cos 23^{circ} = frac{1}{2} [cos(83 + 23) + cos(83 - 23)] = frac{1}{2} [cos 106^{circ} + cos 60^{circ}]]So, subtracting the second term from the first:[frac{1}{2} [cos 74^{circ} + cos 60^{circ}] - frac{1}{2} [cos 106^{circ} + cos 60^{circ}]]Factor out the 1/2:[frac{1}{2} [cos 74^{circ} + cos 60^{circ} - cos 106^{circ} - cos 60^{circ}]]Simplify the terms:The (cos 60^{circ}) terms cancel out:[frac{1}{2} [cos 74^{circ} - cos 106^{circ}]]Now, I remember another identity for the difference of cosines:[cos A - cos B = -2 sin left( frac{A + B}{2} right) sin left( frac{A - B}{2} right)]Let me apply this to (cos 74^{circ} - cos 106^{circ}):Here, (A = 74^{circ}) and (B = 106^{circ}):[cos 74^{circ} - cos 106^{circ} = -2 sin left( frac{74 + 106}{2} right) sin left( frac{74 - 106}{2} right)]Calculate the angles:[frac{74 + 106}{2} = frac{180}{2} = 90^{circ}][frac{74 - 106}{2} = frac{-32}{2} = -16^{circ}]So, substituting back:[-2 sin 90^{circ} sin (-16^{circ})]We know that (sin 90^{circ} = 1) and (sin(-theta) = -sin theta), so:[-2 times 1 times (-sin 16^{circ}) = 2 sin 16^{circ}]Therefore, the numerator simplifies to:[frac{1}{2} times 2 sin 16^{circ} = sin 16^{circ}]Great, so the numerator is (sin 16^{circ}). Now, let's move on to the denominator:[cos 128^{circ} cos 68^{circ} - cos 38^{circ} cos 22^{circ}]Again, I'll apply the product-to-sum identity to each term.First term:[cos 128^{circ} cos 68^{circ} = frac{1}{2} [cos(128 + 68) + cos(128 - 68)] = frac{1}{2} [cos 196^{circ} + cos 60^{circ}]]Second term:[cos 38^{circ} cos 22^{circ} = frac{1}{2} [cos(38 + 22) + cos(38 - 22)] = frac{1}{2} [cos 60^{circ} + cos 16^{circ}]]Subtracting the second term from the first:[frac{1}{2} [cos 196^{circ} + cos 60^{circ}] - frac{1}{2} [cos 60^{circ} + cos 16^{circ}]]Factor out the 1/2:[frac{1}{2} [cos 196^{circ} + cos 60^{circ} - cos 60^{circ} - cos 16^{circ}]]Simplify the terms:The (cos 60^{circ}) terms cancel out:[frac{1}{2} [cos 196^{circ} - cos 16^{circ}]]Again, using the difference of cosines identity:[cos A - cos B = -2 sin left( frac{A + B}{2} right) sin left( frac{A - B}{2} right)]Here, (A = 196^{circ}) and (B = 16^{circ}):[cos 196^{circ} - cos 16^{circ} = -2 sin left( frac{196 + 16}{2} right) sin left( frac{196 - 16}{2} right)]Calculate the angles:[frac{196 + 16}{2} = frac{212}{2} = 106^{circ}][frac{196 - 16}{2} = frac{180}{2} = 90^{circ}]So, substituting back:[-2 sin 106^{circ} sin 90^{circ}]We know that (sin 90^{circ} = 1), so:[-2 sin 106^{circ} times 1 = -2 sin 106^{circ}]Therefore, the denominator simplifies to:[frac{1}{2} times (-2 sin 106^{circ}) = -sin 106^{circ}]Wait, hold on. Let me double-check that step. The expression was:[frac{1}{2} [cos 196^{circ} - cos 16^{circ}] = frac{1}{2} times (-2 sin 106^{circ} sin 90^{circ}) = frac{1}{2} times (-2 sin 106^{circ}) = -sin 106^{circ}]Yes, that's correct.So, the denominator is (-sin 106^{circ}).Now, let's note that (sin 106^{circ}) can be expressed as (sin(180^{circ} - 74^{circ}) = sin 74^{circ}). Because sine is positive in the second quadrant and (sin(180^{circ} - theta) = sin theta).Therefore, (sin 106^{circ} = sin 74^{circ}). So, the denominator is (-sin 74^{circ}).Putting it all together, the fraction simplifies to:[frac{sin 16^{circ}}{ -sin 74^{circ}} = -frac{sin 16^{circ}}{sin 74^{circ}}]Hmm, let's see if we can relate (sin 74^{circ}) to (sin 16^{circ}). Again, using the identity (sin(90^{circ} - theta) = cos theta), so:[sin 74^{circ} = sin(90^{circ} - 16^{circ}) = cos 16^{circ}]Therefore, the fraction becomes:[-frac{sin 16^{circ}}{cos 16^{circ}} = -tan 16^{circ}]So, the entire expression is:[-tan 16^{circ} - tan 164^{circ}]Wait, hold on. The original expression was:[frac{text{numerator}}{text{denominator}} - tan 164^{circ}]Which we found to be:[-tan 16^{circ} - tan 164^{circ}]Now, let's evaluate (tan 164^{circ}). 164 degrees is in the second quadrant, where tangent is negative. Also, 164 degrees can be expressed as 180 - 16 degrees. So:[tan 164^{circ} = tan(180^{circ} - 16^{circ}) = -tan 16^{circ}]Because tangent is periodic with period 180 degrees and is negative in the second quadrant.Therefore, substituting back:[-tan 16^{circ} - (-tan 16^{circ}) = -tan 16^{circ} + tan 16^{circ} = 0]Wait, so the entire expression simplifies to zero? That seems too straightforward. Let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.Starting with the numerator:- Applied product-to-sum correctly, ended up with (sin 16^{circ}). That seems right.Denominator:- Applied product-to-sum, ended up with (-sin 106^{circ}), which is (-sin 74^{circ}), which is (-cos 16^{circ}). So, the fraction is (-tan 16^{circ}). That seems correct.Then, subtracting (tan 164^{circ}), which is (-tan 16^{circ}), so:[-tan 16^{circ} - (-tan 16^{circ}) = 0]Yes, that seems correct.Alternatively, maybe I can check using approximate values.Let me compute each part numerically.First, compute the numerator:[cos 67^{circ} cos 7^{circ} - cos 83^{circ} cos 23^{circ}]Compute each cosine:- (cos 67^{circ} approx 0.3907)- (cos 7^{circ} approx 0.9925)- (cos 83^{circ} approx 0.1219)- (cos 23^{circ} approx 0.9205)Compute the products:- (0.3907 times 0.9925 approx 0.3875)- (0.1219 times 0.9205 approx 0.1123)Subtracting: (0.3875 - 0.1123 approx 0.2752)Now, the denominator:[cos 128^{circ} cos 68^{circ} - cos 38^{circ} cos 22^{circ}]Compute each cosine:- (cos 128^{circ} approx -0.6157) (since 128 is in the second quadrant)- (cos 68^{circ} approx 0.3746)- (cos 38^{circ} approx 0.7880)- (cos 22^{circ} approx 0.9272)Compute the products:- (-0.6157 times 0.3746 approx -0.2301)- (0.7880 times 0.9272 approx 0.7323)Subtracting: (-0.2301 - 0.7323 approx -0.9624)So, the fraction is approximately (0.2752 / (-0.9624) approx -0.2858)Now, compute (tan 164^{circ}):164 degrees is in the second quadrant, so tangent is negative.(tan 164^{circ} = tan(180 - 16) = -tan 16^{circ})Compute (tan 16^{circ} approx 0.2867), so (tan 164^{circ} approx -0.2867)Therefore, the entire expression is:[-0.2858 - (-0.2867) = -0.2858 + 0.2867 approx 0.0009]Which is approximately zero, considering rounding errors. So, that supports the earlier conclusion that the expression simplifies to zero.Therefore, after careful step-by-step evaluation and verification, I can confidently say that the expression equals zero.**Final Answer**boxed{0}"},{"question":"What integer value of n will satisfy n + 10 > 11 and -4n > -12?","answer":"To solve the inequalities, I'll start with the first one: ( n + 10 > 11 ).

Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.First, I know that (lg) is the logarithm base 10. So, (lg x) means (log_{10} x). That might come in handy later.Looking at the given equation: (lg ^{2} x + lg ^{2} y = lg 10 x^{2} + lg 10 y^{2}). Let me rewrite that for clarity:[(lg x)^2 + (lg y)^2 = lg(10x^2) + lg(10y^2)]I think I can simplify the right-hand side using logarithm properties. Remember that (lg(ab) = lg a + lg b), so:[lg(10x^2) = lg 10 + lg x^2 = 1 + 2lg x]Similarly,[lg(10y^2) = 1 + 2lg y]So substituting back into the equation:[(lg x)^2 + (lg y)^2 = [1 + 2lg x] + [1 + 2lg y]]Simplify the right side:[(lg x)^2 + (lg y)^2 = 2 + 2lg x + 2lg y]Let me denote ( a = lg x ) and ( b = lg y ) to make the equation less cluttered. Since ( x geq 1 ) and ( y geq 1 ), ( a ) and ( b ) are non-negative because logarithm of numbers greater than or equal to 1 is non-negative.So substituting, the equation becomes:[a^2 + b^2 = 2 + 2a + 2b]Let me rearrange this equation to bring all terms to one side:[a^2 + b^2 - 2a - 2b - 2 = 0]Hmm, this looks like a quadratic in terms of ( a ) and ( b ). Maybe I can complete the square for both ( a ) and ( b ) to simplify it.Starting with the ( a ) terms:( a^2 - 2a ) can be written as ( (a - 1)^2 - 1 ).Similarly, for the ( b ) terms:( b^2 - 2b ) can be written as ( (b - 1)^2 - 1 ).Substituting these back into the equation:[[(a - 1)^2 - 1] + [(b - 1)^2 - 1] - 2 = 0]Simplify the constants:[(a - 1)^2 + (b - 1)^2 - 1 - 1 - 2 = 0][(a - 1)^2 + (b - 1)^2 - 4 = 0][(a - 1)^2 + (b - 1)^2 = 4]Ah, so this is the equation of a circle centered at (1, 1) with radius 2 in the ( a )-( b ) plane. That's a nice geometric interpretation.Now, the problem asks for the maximum value of ( u = lg(xy) ). Let's express ( u ) in terms of ( a ) and ( b ):[u = lg(xy) = lg x + lg y = a + b]So, we need to maximize ( a + b ) given that ( (a - 1)^2 + (b - 1)^2 = 4 ) and ( a geq 0 ), ( b geq 0 ) (since ( x geq 1 ), ( y geq 1 )).This is a standard optimization problem where we need to find the maximum of a linear function ( a + b ) subject to a circular constraint.I remember that the maximum value of ( a + b ) on a circle can be found by considering the point where the line ( a + b = k ) is tangent to the circle. The maximum ( k ) is achieved when the line is tangent to the circle in the direction of increasing ( a + b ).Alternatively, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers, but since it's a circle, maybe using parametric equations or vector approach would be simpler.Let me parametrize the circle:Let ( a = 1 + 2costheta ) and ( b = 1 + 2sintheta ), since the circle is centered at (1,1) with radius 2.Then, ( a + b = 1 + 2costheta + 1 + 2sintheta = 2 + 2(costheta + sintheta) ).So, ( u = a + b = 2 + 2(costheta + sintheta) ).To find the maximum value of ( u ), we need to maximize ( costheta + sintheta ).I know that ( costheta + sintheta ) can be rewritten as ( sqrt{2}sin(theta + 45^circ) ) or ( sqrt{2}cos(theta - 45^circ) ), which has a maximum value of ( sqrt{2} ).Therefore, the maximum of ( costheta + sintheta ) is ( sqrt{2} ), so the maximum ( u ) is:[u_{text{max}} = 2 + 2 times sqrt{2} = 2 + 2sqrt{2}]But wait, I need to make sure that this point lies within the domain ( a geq 0 ) and ( b geq 0 ). Let me check.Since ( a = 1 + 2costheta ) and ( b = 1 + 2sintheta ), and the radius is 2, the minimum values of ( a ) and ( b ) would be ( 1 - 2 = -1 ). But since ( a ) and ( b ) are non-negative, we must ensure that ( 1 + 2costheta geq 0 ) and ( 1 + 2sintheta geq 0 ).So, ( costheta geq -0.5 ) and ( sintheta geq -0.5 ). That restricts ( theta ) to certain angles where both cosine and sine are not less than -0.5.But since we are looking for the maximum ( u = a + b ), which occurs when ( costheta + sintheta ) is maximum, which is at ( theta = 45^circ ) or ( theta = pi/4 ) radians. Let's check the values at this angle.At ( theta = pi/4 ):( costheta = sintheta = sqrt{2}/2 approx 0.707 )So, ( a = 1 + 2 times 0.707 approx 1 + 1.414 = 2.414 )( b = 1 + 2 times 0.707 approx 2.414 )Both ( a ) and ( b ) are positive, so this is acceptable.Therefore, the maximum value of ( u ) is indeed ( 2 + 2sqrt{2} ).But just to be thorough, let me also consider the method of Lagrange multipliers to confirm.We want to maximize ( f(a, b) = a + b ) subject to the constraint ( g(a, b) = (a - 1)^2 + (b - 1)^2 - 4 = 0 ).The Lagrangian is:[mathcal{L}(a, b, lambda) = a + b - lambda[(a - 1)^2 + (b - 1)^2 - 4]]Taking partial derivatives:[frac{partial mathcal{L}}{partial a} = 1 - lambda times 2(a - 1) = 0][frac{partial mathcal{L}}{partial b} = 1 - lambda times 2(b - 1) = 0][frac{partial mathcal{L}}{partial lambda} = -( (a - 1)^2 + (b - 1)^2 - 4 ) = 0]From the first equation:[1 = 2lambda(a - 1) implies lambda = frac{1}{2(a - 1)}]From the second equation:[1 = 2lambda(b - 1) implies lambda = frac{1}{2(b - 1)}]Setting the two expressions for ( lambda ) equal:[frac{1}{2(a - 1)} = frac{1}{2(b - 1)} implies a - 1 = b - 1 implies a = b]So, at the extremum, ( a = b ). Let's substitute this into the constraint equation:[(a - 1)^2 + (a - 1)^2 = 4 implies 2(a - 1)^2 = 4 implies (a - 1)^2 = 2 implies a - 1 = pm sqrt{2}]Since ( a geq 0 ), and ( a = 1 + sqrt{2} ) or ( a = 1 - sqrt{2} ). But ( 1 - sqrt{2} approx -0.414 ), which is negative, so we discard it because ( a geq 0 ).Thus, ( a = 1 + sqrt{2} ), and since ( a = b ), ( b = 1 + sqrt{2} ).Therefore, ( u = a + b = 2 + 2sqrt{2} ), which matches our earlier result.Just to make sure, let me compute ( x ) and ( y ) from ( a ) and ( b ):( a = lg x = 1 + sqrt{2} implies x = 10^{1 + sqrt{2}} )Similarly, ( y = 10^{1 + sqrt{2}} )So, ( x = y = 10^{1 + sqrt{2}} ), which is greater than 1, so it satisfies the given conditions.Let me verify the original equation with these values.Compute left-hand side (LHS):[(lg x)^2 + (lg y)^2 = (1 + sqrt{2})^2 + (1 + sqrt{2})^2 = 2 times (1 + 2sqrt{2} + 2) = 2 times (3 + 2sqrt{2}) = 6 + 4sqrt{2}]Compute right-hand side (RHS):[lg(10x^2) + lg(10y^2) = [1 + 2lg x] + [1 + 2lg y] = 2 + 2(1 + sqrt{2}) + 2(1 + sqrt{2}) = 2 + 4 + 4sqrt{2} = 6 + 4sqrt{2}]So, LHS = RHS, which confirms that our solution is correct.Therefore, the maximum value of ( u = lg(xy) ) is ( 2 + 2sqrt{2} ).**Final Answer**The maximum value of ( u ) is boxed{2 + 2sqrt{2}}."},{"question":"Eight people are sitting around a circular table, each holding a fair coin.

If it lands heads, they stand up; tails, they stay seated. I need to find the probability that no two adjacent people will stand up. The answer choices are given, so that might help if I get stuck, but I should try to figure it out myself first.Hmm, let's see. Since it's a circular table, the arrangement is a circle, which means the first and last people are also adjacent. So, the problem is about counting the number of valid configurations where no two adjacent people are standing, and then dividing that by the total number of possible configurations.First, the total number of possible outcomes is 2^8, since each person has two possible outcomes, heads or tails. 2^8 is 256, so the denominator of the probability will be 256.Now, the tricky part is figuring out the numerator: the number of valid configurations where no two adjacent people are standing. Since it's a circular table, this is a bit more complicated than a straight line because the first and last positions are adjacent.I remember that for linear arrangements, the number of ways to arrange people so that no two adjacent are standing is similar to the Fibonacci sequence. Let me recall: for n people in a line, the number of valid configurations is F(n+2), where F is the Fibonacci sequence. But since this is a circle, it's a bit different because the first and last positions are adjacent. So, maybe I need to adjust the formula for circular arrangements.I think the formula for circular arrangements is a bit more involved. Let me think. For circular arrangements, the number of valid configurations is F(n) + F(n-2), or something like that? Wait, no, maybe it's different.Alternatively, I can model this problem using recurrence relations. Let me try that approach.Let‚Äôs denote the number of valid configurations for n people sitting in a circle as C(n). For a linear arrangement, it's easier because the first and last aren't adjacent, so the number is F(n+2). But for a circle, we have to consider that the first and last positions are adjacent, so we can't have both standing.So, perhaps we can express C(n) in terms of the linear case. Let me think: if we fix the state of the first person, then we can build the rest accordingly.Case 1: The first person is seated. Then, the remaining n-1 people form a line (since the last person is adjacent to the first, but the first is seated, so the last person can be either seated or standing, as long as it doesn't conflict with the second person). Wait, no, actually, since the first is seated, the last person is only adjacent to the second last person and the first, who is seated. So, the last person can be standing or seated, as long as it doesn't conflict with the second last person.Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of recurrence relations.For a linear arrangement, let‚Äôs denote L(n) as the number of valid configurations for n people in a line. Then, L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2). Because if the first person is seated, then the remaining n-1 can be arranged in L(n-1) ways, and if the first person is standing, then the second must be seated, and the remaining n-2 can be arranged in L(n-2) ways.We know that L(1) = 2 (either seated or standing), L(2) = 3 (both seated, first seated and second standing, first standing and second seated). So, L(n) follows the Fibonacci sequence starting from L(1)=2, L(2)=3.So, L(n) = F(n+2), where F(1)=1, F(2)=1, F(3)=2, etc.But for the circular table, we have to adjust for the circular adjacency. So, let's denote C(n) as the number of valid configurations for n people in a circle.To find C(n), we can consider two cases:Case 1: The first person is seated. Then, the remaining n-1 people form a line (since the last person is adjacent to the first, who is seated, so the last person can be either seated or standing, as long as it doesn't conflict with the second last person). So, the number of configurations in this case is L(n-1).Case 2: The first person is standing. Then, the second and the last person must be seated. The remaining n-3 people (from the third to the second last) can be arranged in any valid way, which is L(n-3).Therefore, C(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-3).Since L(n) = F(n+2), then C(n) = F(n+1) + F(n-1).Wait, let me check that substitution:If L(n-1) = F((n-1)+2) = F(n+1)And L(n-3) = F((n-3)+2) = F(n-1)So, yes, C(n) = F(n+1) + F(n-1)But let me verify this with small n.For n=3: Circular table with 3 people. How many valid configurations?Total possible: 8.Valid configurations: Each person can be seated or standing, but no two adjacent can stand.Let's list them:1. All seated: 1 way.2. One person standing: 3 ways.3. Two people standing: but in a circle, any two people are adjacent, so no valid configurations.4. All three standing: invalid.So total valid configurations: 1 + 3 = 4.Using the formula: C(3) = F(4) + F(2) = 3 + 1 = 4. Correct.Another test: n=4.Valid configurations for a circular table of 4.Total possible: 16.Valid configurations:Number of ways where no two adjacent are standing.This is similar to counting the number of independent sets on a cycle graph C4.I think the number is 3. Wait, let me list them:1. All seated: 1 way.2. One person standing: 4 ways.3. Two people standing: but in a circle, two non-adjacent people can stand. In a square, the two opposite can stand. So, there are 2 ways.Wait, so total valid configurations: 1 + 4 + 2 = 7.Wait, but according to the formula:C(4) = F(5) + F(3) = 5 + 2 = 7. Correct.So, the formula seems to hold.Therefore, for n=8, C(8) = F(9) + F(7).We need to compute F(9) and F(7). Let me recall the Fibonacci sequence:F(1) = 1F(2) = 1F(3) = 2F(4) = 3F(5) = 5F(6) = 8F(7) = 13F(8) = 21F(9) = 34So, C(8) = 34 + 13 = 47.Therefore, the number of valid configurations is 47.Hence, the probability is 47/256.Looking at the answer choices, option A is 47/256, so that should be the answer.Wait, but let me double-check my reasoning because sometimes with circular arrangements, especially when dealing with recurrence relations, it's easy to make a mistake.Alternatively, another approach is to use inclusion-exclusion or generating functions, but since the problem is small (n=8), maybe I can think of another way.Alternatively, another way to compute C(n) is to use the formula for the number of independent sets on a cycle graph, which is indeed F(n) + F(n-2). Wait, but earlier I had C(n) = F(n+1) + F(n-1). Let me see:Wait, for n=3, C(3)=4, which is F(4) + F(2)=3+1=4.For n=4, C(4)=7=F(5)+F(3)=5+2=7.For n=5, C(5)=F(6)+F(4)=8+3=11.Let me verify for n=5.Number of valid configurations for 5 people in a circle:Total possible: 32.Valid configurations:1. All seated: 1.2. One standing: 5.3. Two standing: non-adjacent. In a circle, how many ways? For n=5, the number of ways to choose two non-adjacent people is 5. Because each person has two neighbors, so for each person, there are two people they can't choose, but since it's a circle, the number is 5.Wait, actually, for two non-adjacent in a circle of 5: each person has two neighbors, so the number of ways is 5 choose 2 minus the number of adjacent pairs. There are 5 adjacent pairs, so 10 - 5 = 5.So, two standing: 5 ways.4. Three standing: in a circle of 5, can we have three non-adjacent? Let's see. If three people stand, each must have at least one seated between them. But in a circle of 5, placing three people with at least one seat between each is impossible because 3*2=6 >5. So, no valid configurations.Similarly, four or five standing: invalid.So total valid configurations: 1 + 5 + 5 = 11.Which matches C(5)=11.So, the formula seems correct.Therefore, for n=8, C(8)=F(9)+F(7)=34+13=47.Thus, the probability is 47/256, which is option A.But wait, let me think again. I remember that sometimes for circular arrangements, the formula is slightly different because of rotational symmetry or something else, but in this case, since each configuration is distinct regardless of rotation, I think the formula holds.Alternatively, another way to compute C(n) is to consider that in a circular arrangement, the number of valid configurations is equal to L(n) - L(n-2). Wait, no, that doesn't seem right.Wait, actually, another approach is to fix one person's state and then compute accordingly.Let me try that.Suppose we fix person 1 as seated. Then, the remaining 7 people form a line (since person 8 is now adjacent only to person 7, not to person 1, who is seated). So, the number of configurations in this case is L(7).If person 1 is standing, then person 2 and person 8 must be seated. Then, the remaining people from 3 to 7 can be arranged in L(5) ways.Therefore, C(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-3). Which is the same as before.Since L(n) = F(n+2), then C(n) = F(n+1) + F(n-1).So, for n=8, C(8)=F(9)+F(7)=34+13=47.Therefore, the number of valid configurations is 47, total configurations is 256, so probability is 47/256.Looking back at the answer choices, option A is 47/256, so that must be the answer.I think this is solid. I've checked it with smaller n, and the reasoning seems consistent. So, I feel confident that the answer is A.**Final Answer**boxed{A}"},{"question":"Quadratic polynomial ( P(x) ) is such that ( P(P(x)) = x^4 - 2x^3 + 4x^2 - 3x + 4 ). What can be the value of ( P(8) )? List all possible options.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the possible values of ( P(8) ) for a quadratic polynomial ( P(x) ) such that ( P(P(x)) = x^4 - 2x^3 + 4x^2 - 3x + 4 ). Hmm, quadratic polynomials are of the form ( P(x) = ax^2 + bx + c ), right? So, since ( P ) is quadratic, ( P(P(x)) ) would be a composition of two quadratics, which should result in a quartic polynomial, which matches the given expression.Let me write down what I know:1. ( P(x) = ax^2 + bx + c )2. ( P(P(x)) = x^4 - 2x^3 + 4x^2 - 3x + 4 )So, I need to find ( a ), ( b ), and ( c ) such that when I substitute ( P(x) ) into itself, I get the given quartic polynomial. Once I have ( a ), ( b ), and ( c ), I can compute ( P(8) ).Let me start by expanding ( P(P(x)) ). Since ( P(x) = ax^2 + bx + c ), then:( P(P(x)) = a(ax^2 + bx + c)^2 + b(ax^2 + bx + c) + c )Let me expand this step by step.First, compute ( (ax^2 + bx + c)^2 ):( (ax^2 + bx + c)^2 = a^2x^4 + 2abx^3 + (2ac + b^2)x^2 + 2bcx + c^2 )Then, multiply by ( a ):( a(ax^2 + bx + c)^2 = a^3x^4 + 2a^2b x^3 + a(2ac + b^2)x^2 + 2a b c x + a c^2 )Next, compute ( b(ax^2 + bx + c) ):( b(ax^2 + bx + c) = abx^2 + b^2x + bc )Now, add all these together with the last constant ( c ):( P(P(x)) = a^3x^4 + 2a^2b x^3 + a(2ac + b^2)x^2 + 2a b c x + a c^2 + abx^2 + b^2x + bc + c )Now, let's combine like terms:- ( x^4 ) term: ( a^3 )- ( x^3 ) term: ( 2a^2b )- ( x^2 ) term: ( a(2ac + b^2) + ab = 2a^2c + a b^2 + a b )- ( x ) term: ( 2a b c + b^2 )- Constant term: ( a c^2 + b c + c )So, putting it all together:( P(P(x)) = a^3x^4 + 2a^2b x^3 + (2a^2c + a b^2 + a b)x^2 + (2a b c + b^2)x + (a c^2 + b c + c) )Now, this must equal the given polynomial:( x^4 - 2x^3 + 4x^2 - 3x + 4 )Therefore, we can set up equations by equating the coefficients of corresponding powers of ( x ):1. For ( x^4 ): ( a^3 = 1 )2. For ( x^3 ): ( 2a^2b = -2 )3. For ( x^2 ): ( 2a^2c + a b^2 + a b = 4 )4. For ( x ): ( 2a b c + b^2 = -3 )5. For the constant term: ( a c^2 + b c + c = 4 )Now, let's solve these equations step by step.Starting with equation 1: ( a^3 = 1 ). So, ( a = sqrt[3]{1} ). Since we're dealing with real coefficients, ( a = 1 ).So, ( a = 1 ).Now, substitute ( a = 1 ) into equation 2: ( 2(1)^2b = -2 ) => ( 2b = -2 ) => ( b = -1 ).So, ( b = -1 ).Now, substitute ( a = 1 ) and ( b = -1 ) into equation 3:( 2(1)^2c + (1)(-1)^2 + (1)(-1) = 4 )Simplify:( 2c + 1 - 1 = 4 ) => ( 2c + 0 = 4 ) => ( 2c = 4 ) => ( c = 2 )So, ( c = 2 ).Now, let's check equation 4 with ( a = 1 ), ( b = -1 ), ( c = 2 ):( 2(1)(-1)(2) + (-1)^2 = -3 )Compute:( 2 * 1 * (-1) * 2 = -4 )( (-1)^2 = 1 )So, total: ( -4 + 1 = -3 ), which matches the given coefficient. Good.Now, check equation 5:( (1)(2)^2 + (-1)(2) + 2 = 4 )Compute:( 1 * 4 = 4 )( -1 * 2 = -2 )So, total: ( 4 - 2 + 2 = 4 ), which is correct.So, all equations are satisfied with ( a = 1 ), ( b = -1 ), ( c = 2 ).Therefore, the quadratic polynomial is ( P(x) = x^2 - x + 2 ).Now, we need to find ( P(8) ).Compute ( P(8) = (8)^2 - 8 + 2 = 64 - 8 + 2 = 58 ).Wait, that seems straightforward, but the problem says \\"What can be the value of ( P(8) )? List all possible options.\\" Hmm, so maybe there's more than one possible quadratic polynomial ( P(x) ) that satisfies ( P(P(x)) = x^4 - 2x^3 + 4x^2 - 3x + 4 ). Did I miss something?Let me think. When I solved equation 1, ( a^3 = 1 ), I assumed ( a = 1 ). But in complex numbers, there are other cube roots of 1, but since the problem doesn't specify, I think we can assume ( a ) is real. So, ( a = 1 ) is the only real solution. So, perhaps that's the only quadratic polynomial.But wait, maybe I made a mistake in assuming that ( P(x) ) is monic? Because if ( a ) is 1, then it is monic. But could there be another quadratic polynomial with a different leading coefficient?Wait, but ( P(P(x)) ) is given as a quartic with leading coefficient 1. So, if ( P(x) ) is quadratic, then ( P(P(x)) ) will have leading term ( a times (a x^2)^2 = a^3 x^4 ). Since the leading term is 1, ( a^3 = 1 ), so ( a = 1 ) is the only real solution. So, ( a = 1 ) is fixed.Therefore, ( P(x) ) must be monic quadratic, so ( a = 1 ). Then, ( b = -1 ), ( c = 2 ) is the only solution. So, ( P(x) = x^2 - x + 2 ), and ( P(8) = 64 - 8 + 2 = 58 ).But the problem says \\"What can be the value of ( P(8) )? List all possible options.\\" So, maybe I need to check if there are other quadratics that could satisfy ( P(P(x)) = x^4 - 2x^3 + 4x^2 - 3x + 4 ). Maybe with different coefficients?Wait, but when I solved the equations, I found a unique solution for ( a ), ( b ), and ( c ). So, perhaps 58 is the only possible value.But let me think again. Maybe there are two quadratics, one with ( a = 1 ) and another with ( a = omega ) or ( a = omega^2 ), where ( omega ) is a complex cube root of 1. But since the problem is likely expecting real coefficients, those would not be considered.Alternatively, maybe I can factor the quartic polynomial ( x^4 - 2x^3 + 4x^2 - 3x + 4 ) as ( P(P(x)) ), where ( P(x) ) is quadratic. Maybe there's another quadratic that when composed with itself gives the same quartic.Wait, let me try to factor the quartic. Maybe it factors into two quadratics, which could be ( P(x) ) and another quadratic, but since it's ( P(P(x)) ), it's a composition, not a product.Alternatively, perhaps ( P(x) ) could be a different quadratic, but with the same composition. Hmm, but I don't think so because when I solved the equations, I got a unique solution.Wait, let me double-check my equations.Given ( P(x) = ax^2 + bx + c ), then ( P(P(x)) ) as I expanded earlier. Then, equating coefficients, I got:1. ( a^3 = 1 )2. ( 2a^2b = -2 )3. ( 2a^2c + a b^2 + a b = 4 )4. ( 2a b c + b^2 = -3 )5. ( a c^2 + b c + c = 4 )With ( a = 1 ), ( b = -1 ), ( c = 2 ) as the solution.Is there another solution? For example, maybe ( a = -1 ). Let's see, if ( a = -1 ), then ( a^3 = -1 ), which doesn't equal 1, so that's not possible.Alternatively, maybe ( a ) is a complex number, but as I thought earlier, the problem probably expects real coefficients.Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that ( P(x) ) could be a different quadratic, but with the same composition. Wait, but in my earlier steps, the equations led to a unique solution.Wait, let me see. Suppose that ( P(x) ) is quadratic, so ( P(P(x)) ) is quartic, and the leading coefficient is ( a^3 ). Since the given quartic has leading coefficient 1, ( a^3 = 1 ), so ( a = 1 ) is the only real solution.Therefore, ( a = 1 ), ( b = -1 ), ( c = 2 ) is the only solution, so ( P(8) = 58 ) is the only possible value.Wait, but the problem says \\"List all possible options.\\" Maybe I missed another solution where ( a ) is not 1? But as I saw, ( a^3 = 1 ) only gives ( a = 1 ) in real numbers.Alternatively, perhaps the quartic can be expressed as ( P(P(x)) ) in more than one way, but I don't think so because the equations I set up led to a unique solution.Wait, let me try plugging in ( P(x) = x^2 - x + 2 ) into ( P(P(x)) ) to see if it indeed gives the quartic.Compute ( P(P(x)) ):First, ( P(x) = x^2 - x + 2 ).Then, ( P(P(x)) = (x^2 - x + 2)^2 - (x^2 - x + 2) + 2 ).Compute ( (x^2 - x + 2)^2 ):( x^4 - 2x^3 + (1 + 4)x^2 - 4x + 4 ) Wait, let me compute it properly.Wait, ( (x^2 - x + 2)^2 = x^4 + (-x)^2 + 2^2 + cross terms.Wait, more carefully:( (x^2 - x + 2)(x^2 - x + 2) )Multiply term by term:First, ( x^2 * x^2 = x^4 )Then, ( x^2 * (-x) = -x^3 )Then, ( x^2 * 2 = 2x^2 )Next, ( (-x) * x^2 = -x^3 )Then, ( (-x) * (-x) = x^2 )Then, ( (-x) * 2 = -2x )Next, ( 2 * x^2 = 2x^2 )Then, ( 2 * (-x) = -2x )Finally, ( 2 * 2 = 4 )Now, add all these terms:( x^4 + (-x^3 - x^3) + (2x^2 + x^2 + 2x^2) + (-2x - 2x) + 4 )Simplify:( x^4 - 2x^3 + (5x^2) + (-4x) + 4 )So, ( (x^2 - x + 2)^2 = x^4 - 2x^3 + 5x^2 - 4x + 4 )Now, subtract ( (x^2 - x + 2) ):( x^4 - 2x^3 + 5x^2 - 4x + 4 - x^2 + x - 2 )Simplify:( x^4 - 2x^3 + (5x^2 - x^2) + (-4x + x) + (4 - 2) )Which is:( x^4 - 2x^3 + 4x^2 - 3x + 2 )Then, add 2:( x^4 - 2x^3 + 4x^2 - 3x + 2 + 2 = x^4 - 2x^3 + 4x^2 - 3x + 4 )Which matches the given quartic. So, yes, ( P(x) = x^2 - x + 2 ) is correct, and ( P(8) = 58 ).But the problem says \\"List all possible options.\\" So, maybe I need to consider that ( P(x) ) could be another quadratic that when composed with itself gives the same quartic. But from the equations, I only found one solution. Maybe I need to check if there are other quadratics, perhaps with different coefficients, that could satisfy ( P(P(x)) = x^4 - 2x^3 + 4x^2 - 3x + 4 ).Wait, let me think about the composition. Suppose ( P(x) ) is quadratic, so ( P(P(x)) ) is quartic. But maybe ( P(x) ) could be a different quadratic that when composed with itself gives the same quartic. But in my earlier steps, the system of equations led to a unique solution for ( a ), ( b ), and ( c ). So, perhaps 58 is the only possible value.Alternatively, maybe I can consider that ( P(x) ) could be a quadratic with a different leading coefficient, but as I saw earlier, ( a^3 = 1 ) implies ( a = 1 ) in real numbers.Wait, but let me think again. Suppose ( P(x) ) is quadratic, so ( P(P(x)) ) is quartic. The leading term of ( P(P(x)) ) is ( a times (a x^2)^2 = a^3 x^4 ). Since the given quartic has leading term ( x^4 ), ( a^3 = 1 ), so ( a = 1 ) is the only real solution. Therefore, ( a = 1 ) is fixed.So, with ( a = 1 ), we solved for ( b ) and ( c ) and got ( b = -1 ), ( c = 2 ). So, that's the only quadratic polynomial that satisfies ( P(P(x)) = x^4 - 2x^3 + 4x^2 - 3x + 4 ).Therefore, ( P(8) = 8^2 - 8 + 2 = 64 - 8 + 2 = 58 ).Wait, but the problem says \\"List all possible options.\\" Maybe I'm missing something. Perhaps the quartic can be expressed as ( P(P(x)) ) in more than one way, but I don't think so because the equations led to a unique solution.Alternatively, maybe I can consider that ( P(x) ) could be a quadratic with a different arrangement of coefficients, but I don't see how because the equations are determined uniquely.Wait, let me try to see if there's another quadratic ( P(x) ) such that ( P(P(x)) ) is the given quartic. Suppose ( P(x) = x^2 + bx + c ). Then, following the same steps, we'd get the same equations, leading to ( b = -1 ), ( c = 2 ). So, no other solutions.Alternatively, maybe ( P(x) ) could be a quadratic with a different form, but I don't think so because the composition uniquely determines the coefficients.Wait, another thought: perhaps ( P(x) ) could be a quadratic that's a reflection or something, but I don't think that would change the composition.Alternatively, maybe I can consider that ( P(x) ) could be a quadratic with ( a = 1 ), but different ( b ) and ( c ). But from the equations, ( b ) and ( c ) are uniquely determined once ( a ) is fixed.So, I think the only possible value is 58.Wait, but let me think again. Maybe I can consider that ( P(x) ) could be a quadratic with ( a = 1 ), but with different roots or something. But no, because the composition is fixed.Alternatively, maybe I can consider that ( P(x) ) could be a different quadratic, but when composed with itself, it gives the same quartic. But from the equations, I don't see how that's possible because the system of equations is linear in ( b ) and ( c ) once ( a ) is fixed.Wait, let me check the equations again:1. ( a^3 = 1 ) => ( a = 1 )2. ( 2a^2b = -2 ) => ( b = -1 )3. ( 2a^2c + a b^2 + a b = 4 ) => ( 2c + 1 - 1 = 4 ) => ( 2c = 4 ) => ( c = 2 )4. ( 2a b c + b^2 = -3 ) => ( 2 * 1 * (-1) * 2 + (-1)^2 = -4 + 1 = -3 ) ‚úîÔ∏è5. ( a c^2 + b c + c = 4 ) => ( 4 + (-2) + 2 = 4 ) ‚úîÔ∏èSo, all equations are satisfied, and the solution is unique. Therefore, ( P(x) = x^2 - x + 2 ) is the only quadratic polynomial that satisfies ( P(P(x)) = x^4 - 2x^3 + 4x^2 - 3x + 4 ).Therefore, ( P(8) = 8^2 - 8 + 2 = 64 - 8 + 2 = 58 ).So, the only possible value is 58.Wait, but the problem says \\"List all possible options.\\" Maybe I need to consider that ( P(x) ) could be a different quadratic, but I don't see how because the equations led to a unique solution.Alternatively, maybe I can consider that ( P(x) ) could be a quadratic with ( a = 1 ), but with different ( b ) and ( c ), but as I saw, the equations uniquely determine ( b ) and ( c ).Therefore, I think the only possible value is 58.**Final Answer**The possible value of ( P(8) ) is boxed{58}."},{"question":"A right triangle has an area of 120 square units, and a leg length of 24 units. What is the perimeter of the triangle, in units?","answer":"First, I recognize that the triangle is a right triangle with one leg measuring 24 units and an area of 120 square units. To find the perimeter, I need to determine the lengths of the other leg and the hypotenuse.I'll start by using the area formula for a right triangle, which is (1/2) * base * height.

Each minute, Carlson erases any two numbers and writes their sum on the board, then eats a number of candies equal to the product of the two erased numbers. What is the maximum number of candies he could eat in 46 minutes?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where there are 46 ones written on the board. Every minute, Carlson erases any two numbers and writes their sum on the board. He also eats candies equal to the product of the two erased numbers. The question is asking for the maximum number of candies he could eat in 46 minutes. Hmm, interesting.Let me try to understand the problem step by step. We start with 46 ones. Each minute, Carlson combines two numbers by adding them together and replaces the two with their sum. So, each operation reduces the total count of numbers on the board by one. Starting with 46, after one minute, there will be 45 numbers, then 44, and so on until after 45 minutes, there will be just one number left. Wait, but the problem says 46 minutes. Hmm, that seems confusing because starting with 46 numbers, each operation reduces the count by one, so after 45 operations, we should have one number left. So, why does the problem say 46 minutes? Maybe I'm misunderstanding something.Wait, perhaps the process continues until only one number is left, which would take 45 operations. But the problem says 46 minutes. Maybe it's a typo, or maybe I need to consider something else. Hmm. Let me think. If we have 46 numbers, each operation reduces the count by one, so after 45 operations, we have one number. So, in 45 minutes, he would have done all the operations. But the problem says 46 minutes. Maybe the initial count is 46, and each minute he does one operation, so in 46 minutes, he would have done 46 operations, but starting with 46 numbers, that would require 45 operations to get down to one number. So, perhaps the problem is correct, and maybe after 46 operations, he somehow ends up with a negative number of numbers? That doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm overcomplicating.Wait, perhaps the problem is that each minute, he erases two numbers and writes one, so each minute reduces the count by one. So, starting with 46, after 46 minutes, he would have erased 46 numbers, but each operation erases two and writes one, so the total reduction is one per minute. So, starting with 46, after 46 minutes, he would have 46 - 46 = 0 numbers left. But that can't be, because each operation requires at least two numbers to erase. So, after 45 operations, he would have one number left, and then he can't perform any more operations. So, perhaps the problem is incorrect in stating 46 minutes, or maybe I'm missing something.Wait, maybe the problem is that he starts with 46 ones, and each minute he erases two numbers, so in 46 minutes, he would have erased 92 numbers, but he only has 46 to start with. That doesn't make sense. So, perhaps the problem is intended to have 45 minutes, but it says 46. Alternatively, maybe the initial count is 47, but it says 46. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the problem is correct, and I'm supposed to consider that he can somehow perform 46 operations, but that would require starting with more numbers. Maybe I need to think differently.Wait, perhaps the problem is correct, and the answer is 45 operations, but the problem says 46 minutes. Maybe it's a trick question where the maximum number of candies is achieved by doing 45 operations, but the problem says 46 minutes, so maybe he can't do 46 operations because he runs out of numbers. So, perhaps the maximum number of candies is the same as if he did 45 operations, but the problem is asking for 46 minutes. Hmm, I'm confused.Wait, maybe I should proceed assuming that the problem is correct, and that he can perform 46 operations, even though starting with 46 ones, that would require starting with more numbers. Maybe the problem is intended to have 46 operations, so perhaps the initial count is 47, but it says 46. Hmm, maybe I should proceed with the assumption that the problem is correct, and that he can perform 46 operations, even though that would require starting with more numbers. Alternatively, maybe the problem is correct, and the answer is 45 operations, but the problem says 46 minutes, so maybe the answer is the same as 45 operations.Wait, perhaps I should focus on the process rather than the number of minutes. Each operation, he combines two numbers and eats candies equal to their product. So, to maximize the total candies, he should maximize the product at each step. So, the strategy would be to combine the two largest numbers available at each step. Because the product is maximized when the two numbers are as large as possible.Wait, but starting with all ones, the first step would be to combine two ones, resulting in a two, and eating 1*1=1 candy. Then, the next step would be to combine another two ones, resulting in another two, and eating another 1 candy. But if instead, he combines a one and a two, he would get a three and eat 1*2=2 candies, which is more. So, perhaps the strategy is to combine the largest available number with a one as late as possible.Wait, let me think. If he combines two ones first, he gets a two and eats 1 candy. Then, he has 44 ones and one two. Then, if he combines two ones again, he gets another two, and eats another 1 candy. Alternatively, he could combine a one and a two, getting a three and eating 2 candies. So, in the second step, combining a one and a two gives more candies. So, perhaps the optimal strategy is to combine the largest number with a one as early as possible.Wait, but if he does that, he can create larger numbers earlier, which can then be combined with other large numbers to get even larger products. So, maybe the optimal strategy is to combine the two largest numbers at each step. Let me test this.Let's say we have numbers: 1,1,1,...,1 (46 times).First step: combine two ones to get 2, eating 1 candy. Now we have 44 ones and one 2.Second step: combine two ones to get another 2, eating 1 candy. Now we have 42 ones and two 2s.Third step: combine two ones to get another 2, eating 1 candy. Now we have 40 ones and three 2s.Wait, but if instead, in the second step, we combine a one and a two, we get a three and eat 2 candies. So, that's better. So, maybe the optimal strategy is to combine the largest number with a one as early as possible.Wait, let's try that.First step: combine two ones to get 2, eat 1 candy. Now we have 44 ones and one 2.Second step: combine a one and the two to get 3, eat 2 candies. Now we have 43 ones and one 3.Third step: combine a one and the three to get 4, eat 3 candies. Now we have 42 ones and one 4.Fourth step: combine a one and the four to get 5, eat 4 candies. Now we have 41 ones and one 5.And so on, each time combining the largest number with a one, creating a new number that's one larger, and eating candies equal to that number.Wait, but if we do this, each step after the first would be combining a one with the current largest number, which is increasing by one each time. So, the candies eaten would be 1, 2, 3, 4, ..., up to 45.Wait, because starting from 46 ones, each time we combine a one with the current largest number, we reduce the number of ones by one and increase the largest number by one. So, after 45 operations, we would have combined all the ones into a single number, which would be 46, and the total candies eaten would be the sum from 1 to 45.Wait, but that would be 45 operations, not 46. So, perhaps the problem is intended to have 45 operations, but it says 46 minutes. Alternatively, maybe the initial count is 47, but it says 46. Hmm.Wait, but let's think again. If we have 46 ones, and each operation reduces the count by one, then after 45 operations, we have one number left. So, in 45 minutes, he would have done all the operations. So, the problem says 46 minutes, which is one more than needed. Maybe he can't do anything in the 46th minute, so the total candies would still be the sum from 1 to 45.Wait, but let me calculate that sum. The sum from 1 to n is n(n+1)/2. So, sum from 1 to 45 is 45*46/2 = 1035. So, if he does 45 operations, he can eat 1035 candies. But the problem says 46 minutes, so maybe he can do 46 operations, but that would require starting with 47 numbers, which we don't have. So, perhaps the problem is correct, and the answer is 1035.Wait, but maybe there's a different strategy where he can get more candies in 46 operations. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the problem is correct, and the answer is 1035, even though it says 46 minutes. Maybe the extra minute doesn't contribute anything because he can't perform an operation.Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again.\\"Each minute, Carlson erases any two numbers and writes their sum on the board, then eats a number of candies equal to the product of the two erased numbers. What is the maximum number of candies he could eat in 46 minutes?\\"So, each minute, he does one operation, which takes two numbers and replaces them with their sum, and eats candies equal to the product. So, starting with 46 numbers, each operation reduces the count by one, so after 46 operations, he would have 46 - 46 = 0 numbers left, which is impossible because he needs two numbers to perform an operation. So, the maximum number of operations he can perform is 45, leaving one number. So, in 45 minutes, he can perform 45 operations, and in the 46th minute, he can't do anything. So, the total candies would be the sum from 1 to 45, which is 1035.Wait, but maybe there's a way to perform 46 operations by starting with 47 numbers, but the problem says 46. Hmm.Alternatively, maybe the problem is correct, and the answer is 1035, even though it says 46 minutes. So, perhaps the answer is 1035.Wait, but let me think again. If he combines the two largest numbers each time, he can get a higher product earlier, which might lead to a higher total. Let me try that approach.Starting with 46 ones.First operation: combine two ones to get 2, eat 1 candy.Now we have 44 ones and one 2.Second operation: combine two ones to get another 2, eat 1 candy.Now we have 42 ones and two 2s.Third operation: combine two ones to get another 2, eat 1 candy.Now we have 40 ones and three 2s.Wait, but if instead, in the second operation, we combine a one and a two to get a three, eating 2 candies. That's better.So, let's try that.First operation: combine two ones to get 2, eat 1.Second operation: combine one and two to get 3, eat 2.Now we have 43 ones, one 3.Third operation: combine one and three to get 4, eat 3.Now we have 42 ones, one 4.Fourth operation: combine one and four to get 5, eat 4.And so on, until we have combined all ones into a single number, 46, and the total candies eaten would be 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 45 = 1035.Alternatively, if we combine the two largest numbers each time, starting with two ones, then two ones again, etc., we would get a different result.Wait, let's try that.First operation: combine two ones to get 2, eat 1.Second operation: combine two ones to get another 2, eat 1.Third operation: combine two ones to get another 2, eat 1....After 23 operations, we would have 23 twos, and have eaten 23 candies.Then, in the 24th operation, combine two twos to get 4, eat 4 candies.Now we have 21 twos and one 4.25th operation: combine two twos to get another 4, eat 4.Now we have 19 twos and two 4s.26th operation: combine two twos to get another 4, eat 4....After 23 more operations (total 46 operations), we would have combined all twos into 23 fours, but wait, that's not possible because each operation reduces the count by one. Wait, starting with 23 twos, each operation reduces the count by one, so after 22 operations, we would have one 4 and 22 fours? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again.If we have 23 twos, each operation combines two twos into a four, eating 4 candies each time. So, each operation reduces the number of twos by two and increases the number of fours by one. So, starting with 23 twos, we can perform 11 operations, combining 22 twos into 11 fours, and have one two left. So, after 11 operations, we have 11 fours and one two.Then, in the next operation, we can combine two fours into an eight, eating 16 candies. Then, we have 10 fours and one eight.Wait, but this seems like a different strategy, and the total candies eaten would be different.Wait, let's calculate the total candies in this strategy.First 23 operations: combining two ones each time, eating 1 candy each, total 23.Then, 11 operations combining two twos into fours, eating 4 each, total 44.Then, 10 operations combining two fours into eights, eating 16 each, total 160.Then, 5 operations combining two eights into sixteens, eating 64 each, total 320.Then, 2 operations combining two sixteens into thirty-twos, eating 256 each, total 512.Then, 1 operation combining two thirty-twos into sixty-four, eating 1024.Wait, but let's count how many operations that is: 23 + 11 + 10 + 5 + 2 + 1 = 52 operations. But we only have 46 minutes, so this strategy would require more operations than allowed.Hmm, so maybe this approach isn't feasible within 46 operations.Alternatively, maybe I should think of this as building a binary tree, where each combination is a node, and the total candies are the sum of the products at each step.Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should think in terms of the total sum.Wait, the total sum of the numbers on the board remains constant throughout the process, except that each operation replaces two numbers with their sum, so the total sum is always 46, since we start with 46 ones.Wait, that's an important point. The total sum is always 46, regardless of how we combine the numbers. So, the final number on the board will be 46.But the total candies eaten are the sum of the products of the pairs combined at each step. So, to maximize the total candies, we need to maximize the sum of these products.Wait, but the sum of the products is related to the total sum squared minus the sum of squares, divided by two. Because (a + b + c + ...)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + ... + 2(ab + ac + ...). So, the sum of all pairwise products is [ (sum)^2 - sum of squares ] / 2.In our case, the total sum is 46, and the sum of squares starts at 46*1^2 = 46. Each time we combine two numbers x and y into x+y, the sum of squares becomes (x+y)^2 + sum of the other squares. The change in sum of squares is (x+y)^2 - x^2 - y^2 = 2xy. So, each operation increases the sum of squares by 2xy, which is twice the number of candies eaten in that step.Therefore, the total sum of squares after all operations is 46^2 = 2116. The initial sum of squares is 46. So, the total increase in sum of squares is 2116 - 46 = 2070. Since each operation increases the sum of squares by 2xy, the total candies eaten is 2070 / 2 = 1035.Wait, that's interesting. So, regardless of the order in which Carlson combines the numbers, the total candies eaten will always be 1035. Because the sum of squares increases by 2xy each time, and the total increase is fixed, so the total candies eaten is fixed.Wait, so does that mean that the maximum number of candies he could eat is 1035, regardless of the order? But that contradicts my earlier thought that combining larger numbers later would give a higher total.Wait, but according to this, the total is fixed. So, maybe the order doesn't matter, and the total candies eaten is always 1035.Wait, let me verify this with a smaller example. Suppose we have two ones. Then, Carlson combines them into a two, eating 1 candy. The total candies eaten is 1. The sum of squares starts at 2, and ends at 4. The increase is 2, which is 2*1, so total candies eaten is 1. That matches.Another example: three ones.First, combine two ones into a two, eating 1 candy. Now we have a two and a one.Then, combine the two and the one into a three, eating 2 candies. Total candies eaten: 1 + 2 = 3.Alternatively, if we could combine the two ones first, but with three ones, we have to combine two, then combine the result with the third.Sum of squares: initial is 3. After first operation: 2^2 + 1^2 = 4 + 1 = 5. After second operation: 3^2 = 9. Total increase: 9 - 3 = 6. So, total candies eaten: 6 / 2 = 3. Which matches.Another example: four ones.Strategy 1: Combine two ones into two, eat 1. Then combine two ones into another two, eat 1. Then combine two twos into four, eat 4. Total candies: 1 + 1 + 4 = 6.Sum of squares: initial 4. After first operation: 2^2 + 2*1^2 = 4 + 2 = 6. After second operation: 2^2 + 2^2 = 8. After third operation: 4^2 = 16. Total increase: 16 - 4 = 12. Total candies: 12 / 2 = 6.Strategy 2: Combine one and one into two, eat 1. Then combine two and one into three, eat 2. Then combine three and one into four, eat 3. Total candies: 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.Same result.So, regardless of the order, the total candies eaten is the same. Therefore, in the original problem, the total candies eaten will always be 1035, regardless of the order in which Carlson combines the numbers.Wait, so that means the maximum number of candies he could eat is 1035, and that's the only possible total, regardless of the strategy. So, the answer is 1035.But wait, the problem says \\"What is the maximum number of candies he could eat in 46 minutes?\\" But according to this, it's fixed at 1035, regardless of the order. So, maybe the answer is 1035.But let me think again. If the total is fixed, then the maximum is 1035, and that's the only possible total. So, the answer is 1035.Wait, but in the case of four ones, the total is 6, which is 1+1+4 or 1+2+3. So, regardless of the order, the total is the same. So, in the original problem, the total is fixed, so the maximum is 1035.Therefore, the answer is 1035.But wait, the problem says 46 minutes, but we only need 45 operations to combine 46 ones into one number. So, in the 46th minute, he can't do anything, so the total candies eaten is still 1035.Therefore, the maximum number of candies he could eat in 46 minutes is 1035."},{"question":"Calculate the sum: i + i^2 + i^3 + dots + i^{2012}.","answer":"To calculate the sum ( S = i + i^2 + i^3 + dots + i^{2012} ), I start by recognizing that this is a geometric series with the first term ( a = i ) and the common ratio ( r = i ).The formula for the sum of a geometric series is ( S_n = a frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r} ).

In symbols, that's ‚é£x¬∑‚é£x‚é¶‚é¶ = 29. Hmm, floor functions can be tricky, but let me try to break it down step by step.First, I remember that the floor function, denoted by ‚é£¬∑‚é¶, gives the greatest integer less than or equal to a number. So, for any real number x, ‚é£x‚é¶ is the integer part of x. For example, if x is 3.7, then ‚é£x‚é¶ is 3. If x is -1.2, then ‚é£x‚é¶ is -2 because -2 is the greatest integer less than or equal to -1.2.So, in this problem, we have a nested floor function: first, we take the floor of x, which is ‚é£x‚é¶, then multiply that by x, and then take the floor of the result. The whole thing equals 29.Let me denote ‚é£x‚é¶ as n, where n is an integer. So, n = ‚é£x‚é¶. Then, the equation becomes ‚é£x¬∑n‚é¶ = 29. That means that x¬∑n is a real number whose floor is 29. So, 29 ‚â§ x¬∑n < 30.But since n is the floor of x, we also know that n ‚â§ x < n + 1. So, x is in the interval [n, n + 1). Therefore, x can be written as n + f, where f is the fractional part, such that 0 ‚â§ f < 1.So, substituting x = n + f into the equation x¬∑n, we get (n + f)¬∑n = n¬≤ + n¬∑f. Therefore, 29 ‚â§ n¬≤ + n¬∑f < 30.Since f is between 0 and 1, n¬∑f is between 0 and n. So, n¬≤ ‚â§ n¬≤ + n¬∑f < n¬≤ + n.Therefore, 29 ‚â§ n¬≤ + n¬∑f < 30, and n¬≤ ‚â§ n¬≤ + n¬∑f < n¬≤ + n.So, combining these, we have 29 ‚â§ n¬≤ + n¬∑f < 30 and n¬≤ ‚â§ n¬≤ + n¬∑f < n¬≤ + n.From the second inequality, n¬≤ + n¬∑f < n¬≤ + n, which simplifies to n¬∑f < n. Since n is an integer, and f < 1, this holds as long as n ‚â† 0. If n = 0, then x would be in [0,1), and x¬∑n would be 0, which can't be 29. So, n can't be 0.Therefore, n must be a non-zero integer. Let's consider positive and negative integers separately.First, let's assume n is positive. So, n ‚â• 1.Then, from the inequality 29 ‚â§ n¬≤ + n¬∑f < 30, and since n¬∑f < n, we have n¬≤ ‚â§ 29 + something less than n. Wait, maybe it's better to find possible n such that n¬≤ ‚â§ 29 < n¬≤ + n.Wait, because 29 ‚â§ n¬≤ + n¬∑f < 30, and n¬≤ ‚â§ n¬≤ + n¬∑f < n¬≤ + n. So, n¬≤ ‚â§ 29 < n¬≤ + n.Wait, that might not be correct. Let me think again.We have 29 ‚â§ n¬≤ + n¬∑f < 30, and n¬≤ ‚â§ n¬≤ + n¬∑f < n¬≤ + n.So, combining these, 29 ‚â§ n¬≤ + n¬∑f < 30 and n¬≤ ‚â§ n¬≤ + n¬∑f < n¬≤ + n.Therefore, 29 ‚â§ n¬≤ + n¬∑f < 30 and n¬≤ ‚â§ n¬≤ + n¬∑f < n¬≤ + n.So, the second inequality tells us that n¬≤ + n¬∑f < n¬≤ + n, which is always true because f < 1.The first inequality tells us that 29 ‚â§ n¬≤ + n¬∑f < 30.So, to find n, we can look for integers n such that n¬≤ ‚â§ 29 < n¬≤ + n.Wait, because n¬≤ + n¬∑f is at least n¬≤ and less than n¬≤ + n. So, if 29 is less than n¬≤ + n, then n¬≤ must be less than or equal to 29, and n¬≤ + n must be greater than 29.So, n¬≤ ‚â§ 29 < n¬≤ + n.So, let's solve for n.We can write this as n¬≤ ‚â§ 29 and n¬≤ + n > 29.Let me find integers n where n¬≤ ‚â§ 29 and n¬≤ + n > 29.Let me compute n¬≤ and n¬≤ + n for positive integers:n=1: 1, 2n=2: 4, 6n=3: 9, 12n=4: 16, 20n=5: 25, 30n=6: 36, 42Wait, n=5: n¬≤=25, n¬≤ + n=30. So, 25 ‚â§ 29 < 30. That works because 29 is less than 30.n=6: n¬≤=36, which is greater than 29, so it doesn't satisfy n¬≤ ‚â§29.n=4: n¬≤=16, n¬≤ + n=20. 20 is less than 29, so 29 is not less than 20. So, n=4 doesn't satisfy n¬≤ + n >29.Similarly, n=3: n¬≤=9, n¬≤ + n=12 <29, so no.n=2: 4,6 <29, no.n=1:1,2 <29, no.So, the only positive integer n that satisfies n¬≤ ‚â§29 and n¬≤ +n >29 is n=5.So, n=5.Therefore, x is in [5,6), and we have 29 ‚â§5x <30.So, 29 ‚â§5x <30.Divide all parts by 5: 29/5 ‚â§x <6.29/5 is 5.8, so 5.8 ‚â§x <6.But x is already in [5,6), so the intersection is 5.8 ‚â§x <6.Therefore, x is in [5.8,6).So, any real number x between 5.8 and 6 will satisfy the equation.But wait, let me check if n could be negative.Earlier, I assumed n is positive, but n could also be negative. Let's check.If n is negative, say n = -k where k is a positive integer.Then, x is in [n, n+1) = [-k, -k +1).Then, x¬∑n would be x*(-k). Since x is in [-k, -k +1), x is negative or zero, but since n is negative, x¬∑n would be positive or zero.Wait, let's see:If n is negative, say n = -1, then x is in [-1,0). So, x is negative, and n is -1, so x¬∑n = x*(-1) = -x, which is positive because x is negative.Similarly, for n = -2, x is in [-2,-1), so x is negative, n is -2, so x¬∑n = (-2)*x, which is positive because x is negative.So, in general, for negative n, x¬∑n is positive.So, the equation ‚é£x¬∑n‚é¶ =29 is possible for negative n as well.So, let's consider n negative.Let me denote n = -k, where k is a positive integer.Then, x is in [n, n +1) = [-k, -k +1).Then, x¬∑n = x*(-k) = -k*x.Since x is in [-k, -k +1), x is negative, so -k*x is positive.So, ‚é£-k*x‚é¶ =29.Therefore, 29 ‚â§ -k*x <30.But x is in [-k, -k +1). Let me express x as x = -k + f, where f is in [0,1).So, x = -k + f, 0 ‚â§ f <1.Then, x¬∑n = (-k + f)*(-k) = k¬≤ -k*f.So, ‚é£k¬≤ -k*f‚é¶ =29.Therefore, 29 ‚â§k¬≤ -k*f <30.But since f is in [0,1), k*f is in [0,k).Therefore, k¬≤ -k*f is in (k¬≤ -k, k¬≤].So, 29 ‚â§k¬≤ -k*f <30.But k¬≤ -k*f must be in (k¬≤ -k, k¬≤].So, 29 <k¬≤ and k¬≤ -k*f ‚â•29.Wait, let me think.We have 29 ‚â§k¬≤ -k*f <30.But k¬≤ -k*f is less than k¬≤, because k*f is positive.So, k¬≤ must be greater than 29, because 29 ‚â§k¬≤ -k*f <k¬≤.Therefore, k¬≤ >29.So, k must be greater than sqrt(29). Since k is a positive integer, sqrt(29) is approximately 5.385, so k must be at least 6.So, k=6,7,8,...Let me check for k=6:k=6, so n=-6.Then, x is in [-6, -5).x = -6 + f, 0 ‚â§f <1.x¬∑n = (-6 + f)*(-6) =36 -6f.So, ‚é£36 -6f‚é¶ =29.Therefore, 29 ‚â§36 -6f <30.Subtract 36: -7 ‚â§-6f < -6.Multiply by (-1), which reverses inequalities: 6 <6f ‚â§7.Divide by 6: 1 <f ‚â§7/6.But f is in [0,1), so 1 <f ‚â§7/6 is impossible because f <1.Therefore, no solution for k=6.Wait, that's a problem.

So, no solution.Similarly, k=4: n=-4.x¬∑n=16 -4f.Floor is at most 16, which is less than 29.So, no solution.Therefore, for negative n, there are no solutions.Thus, the only solutions are for positive n=5, which gives x in [5.8,6).Wait, let me verify with an example.Take x=5.8.Then, ‚é£x‚é¶=5.So, x¬∑‚é£x‚é¶=5.8*5=29.Then, ‚é£29‚é¶=29, which matches.Take x=5.9.x¬∑‚é£x‚é¶=5.9*5=29.5.Floor of 29.5 is 29, which is correct.Take x approaching 6 from below, say x=5.999.x¬∑‚é£x‚é¶=5.999*5=29.995.Floor is 29, which is correct.But if x=6, then ‚é£x‚é¶=6, so x¬∑‚é£x‚é¶=6*6=36, floor is 36, which is more than 29.So, x must be less than 6.Similarly, if x=5.8, it's included.What about x=5.7?x¬∑‚é£x‚é¶=5.7*5=28.5.Floor is 28, which is less than 29, so x=5.7 is not a solution.Therefore, x must be at least 5.8.So, the solution set is [5.8,6).Therefore, all real numbers x such that 5.8 ‚â§x <6.Expressed as an interval, that's [29/5,6).But 29/5 is 5.8, so yeah.So, the final answer is all real numbers x with 29/5 ‚â§x <6.**Final Answer**The real numbers ( x ) that satisfy the equation are all real numbers in the interval (left[ frac{29}{5}, 6 right)).

I need to find the value of c such that the roots have a ratio of -3/5. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that for a quadratic equation of the form ax¬≤ + bx + c = 0, the sum of the roots is -b/a and the product of the roots is c/a. Maybe I can use that here.Let me denote the roots as r‚ÇÅ and r‚ÇÇ. According to the problem, the ratio of the roots is -3/5. So, I can write that as r‚ÇÅ/r‚ÇÇ = -3/5. Alternatively, this can be rearranged to r‚ÇÅ = (-3/5)r‚ÇÇ.Now, using Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots r‚ÇÅ + r‚ÇÇ should be equal to -b/a. In this case, a is 5, b is -2, so the sum is -(-2)/5 = 2/5.Similarly, the product of the roots r‚ÇÅ*r‚ÇÇ should be equal to c/a, which is c/5.So, I have two equations:1. r‚ÇÅ + r‚ÇÇ = 2/52. r‚ÇÅ*r‚ÇÇ = c/5And from the ratio, I have r‚ÇÅ = (-3/5)r‚ÇÇ.Let me substitute r‚ÇÅ in the first equation. So, replacing r‚ÇÅ with (-3/5)r‚ÇÇ:(-3/5)r‚ÇÇ + r‚ÇÇ = 2/5Let me compute that:First, combine the terms:(-3/5)r‚ÇÇ + (5/5)r‚ÇÇ = (2/5)r‚ÇÇ = 2/5So, (2/5)r‚ÇÇ = 2/5Then, solving for r‚ÇÇ:Multiply both sides by 5/2:r‚ÇÇ = (2/5)*(5/2) = 1So, r‚ÇÇ is 1. Then, r‚ÇÅ is (-3/5)*r‚ÇÇ = (-3/5)*1 = -3/5.Now, let me find the product of the roots:r‚ÇÅ*r‚ÇÇ = (-3/5)*1 = -3/5But according to Vieta's formula, this product is equal to c/5. So,c/5 = -3/5Multiply both sides by 5:c = -3Wait, so c is -3? Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.1. I set r‚ÇÅ = (-3/5)r‚ÇÇ. That seems right because the ratio is -3/5.2. Then, substituting into the sum: (-3/5)r‚ÇÇ + r‚ÇÇ = 2/5. That simplifies to (2/5)r‚ÇÇ = 2/5, so r‚ÇÇ = 1. That seems correct.3. Then, r‚ÇÅ is (-3/5)*1 = -3/5. That makes sense.4. The product is (-3/5)*1 = -3/5, which equals c/5. So, c = -3. Hmm, that seems consistent.Let me plug c = -3 back into the original equation and check if the roots indeed have a ratio of -3/5.The equation becomes 5x¬≤ - 2x - 3 = 0.Let me solve this quadratic equation.Using the quadratic formula: x = [2 ¬± sqrt( ( -2 )¬≤ - 4*5*(-3) )]/(2*5)Compute discriminant:D = 4 + 60 = 64So, sqrt(D) = 8Thus, x = [2 ¬± 8]/10So, two solutions:x = (2 + 8)/10 = 10/10 = 1x = (2 - 8)/10 = (-6)/10 = -3/5So, the roots are 1 and -3/5. The ratio of the roots is (-3/5)/1 = -3/5, which matches the given ratio. So, that checks out.Therefore, c is indeed -3.Wait, but hold on a second. The ratio is given as -3/5. So, is it r‚ÇÅ/r‚ÇÇ = -3/5 or r‚ÇÇ/r‚ÇÅ = -3/5? I assumed it was r‚ÇÅ/r‚ÇÇ = -3/5, but maybe I should check the other way.If I had assumed r‚ÇÇ/r‚ÇÅ = -3/5, then r‚ÇÇ = (-3/5)r‚ÇÅ. Let's see if that affects the result.Let me try that approach.Let me denote r‚ÇÇ = (-3/5)r‚ÇÅ.Then, the sum of the roots is r‚ÇÅ + r‚ÇÇ = r‚ÇÅ + (-3/5)r‚ÇÅ = (2/5)r‚ÇÅ = 2/5.So, (2/5)r‚ÇÅ = 2/5 => r‚ÇÅ = 1.Then, r‚ÇÇ = (-3/5)*1 = -3/5.Same result. So, regardless of which root is which, the product is still (-3/5)*1 = -3/5, so c is still -3.Therefore, my initial answer is correct.Just to be thorough, let me think if there's another way to approach this problem.Alternatively, if the roots are in the ratio -3/5, then we can express them as -3k and 5k for some constant k. Wait, but that might complicate things because the ratio is negative. Alternatively, maybe 3k and -5k? Let me try that.Let me denote the roots as 3k and -5k. Then, the ratio would be (3k)/(-5k) = -3/5, which is the given ratio.Then, using Vieta's formulas:Sum of roots: 3k + (-5k) = -2k = 2/5So, -2k = 2/5 => k = (2/5)/(-2) = -1/5Then, the roots are 3k = 3*(-1/5) = -3/5 and -5k = -5*(-1/5) = 1.Same roots as before. Then, the product is (-3/5)*1 = -3/5 = c/5 => c = -3.Same result. So, that confirms it again.Alternatively, if I had set the roots as -3k and 5k, the ratio would be (-3k)/(5k) = -3/5, which is correct.Then, sum of roots: (-3k) + 5k = 2k = 2/5 => k = 1/5So, roots are -3*(1/5) = -3/5 and 5*(1/5) = 1. Same result.Product is (-3/5)*1 = -3/5 = c/5 => c = -3.So, regardless of how I set up the roots, I end up with c = -3.Therefore, I can confidently say that c is -3.**Final Answer**The value of ( c ) is boxed{-3}."},{"question":"In a circle with center O and radius r, chord AB is drawn with length equal to r (units).

Let me try to visualize the problem first.We have a circle with center O and radius r. Chord AB is drawn with length equal to r. From O, a perpendicular to AB meets AB at M. Then, from M, a perpendicular to OA meets OA at D. We need to find the area of triangle MDA.Alright, let me break this down step by step.First, let me sketch the circle with center O. Chord AB has length r, which is the same as the radius. Since AB is a chord of the circle, and its length is equal to the radius, I can recall that in a circle, the length of a chord is related to the central angle subtended by the chord.The formula for the length of a chord is:AB = 2r sin(Œ∏/2)where Œ∏ is the central angle in radians.Given that AB = r, we can set up the equation:r = 2r sin(Œ∏/2)Divide both sides by r:1 = 2 sin(Œ∏/2)So, sin(Œ∏/2) = 1/2Therefore, Œ∏/2 = œÄ/6 (since sin(œÄ/6) = 1/2)So, Œ∏ = œÄ/3 radians, which is 60 degrees.Okay, so the central angle AOB is 60 degrees. That means triangle AOB is an equilateral triangle because OA and OB are both radii (length r) and AB is also length r. So, triangle AOB is equilateral.Wait, but hold on. If AB is a chord of length r, and OA and OB are both r, then triangle AOB is equilateral. So, angle AOB is 60 degrees, as we found.Now, from O, a perpendicular to AB meets AB at M. Since AB is a chord, the perpendicular from the center O to AB will bisect AB. So, M is the midpoint of AB.Given that AB is length r, then AM = MB = r/2.So, AM = r/2.Since triangle AOB is equilateral, all sides are equal, and all angles are 60 degrees.Now, we need to find the coordinates or lengths needed to find the area of triangle MDA.Wait, maybe it's better to assign coordinates to the points to make this more concrete.Let me place the circle with center O at the origin (0,0). Let me position point A somewhere on the circle. Since triangle AOB is equilateral, I can place point A at (r/2, (r‚àö3)/2) and point B at (r/2, -(r‚àö3)/2). Wait, is that correct?Wait, no. If angle AOB is 60 degrees, then points A and B can be placed symmetrically with respect to the x-axis. Let me think.Alternatively, maybe it's easier to place point A at (r, 0). Then, since angle AOB is 60 degrees, point B would be at (r cos 60¬∞, r sin 60¬∞). But wait, if OA is along the x-axis, then point B would be at (r cos 60¬∞, r sin 60¬∞). Wait, but that would make AB a chord of 60 degrees, but AB is supposed to have length r.Wait, perhaps I should use coordinates to model this.Let me set point O at (0,0). Let me place point A at (r, 0). Then, since AB is a chord of length r, and the central angle is 60 degrees, point B would be at (r cos 60¬∞, r sin 60¬∞). Let me compute that.cos 60¬∞ = 0.5, sin 60¬∞ = (‚àö3)/2.So, point B is at (0.5r, (‚àö3/2)r).So, chord AB goes from (r, 0) to (0.5r, (‚àö3/2)r). The midpoint M of AB is the average of the coordinates.So, M_x = (r + 0.5r)/2 = (1.5r)/2 = 0.75rM_y = (0 + (‚àö3/2)r)/2 = (‚àö3/4)rSo, point M is at (0.75r, (‚àö3/4)r)Now, from M, we need to draw a perpendicular to OA. OA is the line from O(0,0) to A(r,0), which is along the x-axis. So, OA is the x-axis itself.A perpendicular to OA would be a vertical line, since OA is horizontal. So, from point M, if we draw a vertical line, it will intersect OA at some point D.But wait, OA is along the x-axis, so a perpendicular to OA would be a vertical line. Therefore, the perpendicular from M to OA is a vertical line passing through M. Since OA is the x-axis, the intersection point D will have the same x-coordinate as M, but y-coordinate 0.So, point D is at (0.75r, 0)Therefore, triangle MDA has vertices at M(0.75r, ‚àö3/4 r), D(0.75r, 0), and A(r, 0).Now, let's find the area of triangle MDA.Since we have the coordinates of all three points, we can use the formula for the area of a triangle given coordinates.Alternatively, since two of the points are on the x-axis, we can compute the base and height.Looking at points D(0.75r, 0) and A(r, 0), the base DA is along the x-axis from x=0.75r to x=r, so the length of DA is r - 0.75r = 0.25r.The height of the triangle is the y-coordinate of point M, which is ‚àö3/4 r.Therefore, the area is (base * height)/2 = (0.25r * ‚àö3/4 r)/2Wait, hold on. Wait, no. Wait, actually, in this case, since DA is the base, which is 0.25r, and the height is the vertical distance from M to DA, which is the y-coordinate of M, which is ‚àö3/4 r.Therefore, area = (base * height)/2 = (0.25r * ‚àö3/4 r)/2Wait, no, actually, no. Wait, in the formula, it's (base * height)/2. So, base is 0.25r, height is ‚àö3/4 r.So, area = (0.25r * ‚àö3/4 r)/2? Wait, no, that would be incorrect.Wait, no, actually, base is 0.25r, height is ‚àö3/4 r. So, area is (0.25r) * (‚àö3/4 r) * (1/2). Wait, no, that's not right.Wait, no, the formula is (base * height)/2. So, base is 0.25r, height is ‚àö3/4 r. So, area is (0.25r * ‚àö3/4 r)/2? Wait, no, that's not correct.Wait, no, actually, no. Wait, base is 0.25r, height is ‚àö3/4 r. So, area is (base * height)/2 = (0.25r * ‚àö3/4 r)/2.Wait, that seems complicated. Let me compute it step by step.First, 0.25r is 1/4 r.‚àö3/4 r is (‚àö3)/4 r.So, multiplying them together: (1/4 r) * (‚àö3/4 r) = (1 * ‚àö3) / (4 * 4) * r * r = ‚àö3 / 16 r¬≤.Then, divide by 2: (‚àö3 / 16 r¬≤)/2 = ‚àö3 / 32 r¬≤.Wait, that gives me ‚àö3 / 32 r¬≤, which is option D.But let me verify this because I might have messed up the formula.Alternatively, since triangle MDA is a right triangle? Wait, is it?Wait, point D is at (0.75r, 0), point M is at (0.75r, ‚àö3/4 r), and point A is at (r, 0). So, plotting these points, triangle MDA has a vertical side from D to M, and a horizontal side from D to A, and the hypotenuse from M to A.Wait, actually, no. Because from D to A is along the x-axis, and from D to M is vertical, so triangle MDA is a right triangle with legs DA and DM.Therefore, the area is (DA * DM)/2.DA is the distance from D to A, which is r - 0.75r = 0.25r.DM is the distance from D to M, which is the vertical distance, which is ‚àö3/4 r.Therefore, area = (0.25r * ‚àö3/4 r)/2.Wait, no, hold on. If it's a right triangle, then the area is simply (base * height)/2, where base and height are the legs.So, base = DA = 0.25r, height = DM = ‚àö3/4 r.Therefore, area = (0.25r * ‚àö3/4 r)/2? Wait, no, no, no, no division by 2 again.Wait, no, in a right triangle, area is (leg1 * leg2)/2. So, it's (DA * DM)/2.So, DA = 0.25r, DM = ‚àö3/4 r.Therefore, area = (0.25r * ‚àö3/4 r)/2? Wait, no, that's not correct.Wait, no, hold on. If DA is 0.25r and DM is ‚àö3/4 r, then area is (DA * DM)/2.So, that would be (0.25r * ‚àö3/4 r)/2.Wait, that seems like three divisions by 2, which is not correct.Wait, no, actually, in a right triangle, area is (base * height)/2, where base and height are the two legs. So, in this case, DA is one leg, DM is the other leg.So, area = (DA * DM)/2.So, DA is 0.25r, DM is ‚àö3/4 r.So, area = (0.25r * ‚àö3/4 r)/2.Wait, no, that would be (0.25 * ‚àö3 /4) * r¬≤ /2.Wait, that seems too small.Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.Alternatively, let's use coordinates to compute the area.We have three points:M: (0.75r, ‚àö3/4 r)D: (0.75r, 0)A: (r, 0)We can use the shoelace formula.Shoelace formula for area is:Area = |(x1(y2 - y3) + x2(y3 - y1) + x3(y1 - y2))/2|Plugging in the coordinates:x1 = 0.75r, y1 = ‚àö3/4 rx2 = 0.75r, y2 = 0x3 = r, y3 = 0So,Area = |(0.75r*(0 - 0) + 0.75r*(0 - ‚àö3/4 r) + r*(‚àö3/4 r - 0))/2|Simplify each term:First term: 0.75r*(0 - 0) = 0Second term: 0.75r*(0 - ‚àö3/4 r) = 0.75r*(-‚àö3/4 r) = - (0.75 * ‚àö3 /4) r¬≤Third term: r*(‚àö3/4 r - 0) = r*(‚àö3/4 r) = (‚àö3 /4) r¬≤So, putting it all together:Area = |(0 - (0.75 * ‚àö3 /4) r¬≤ + (‚àö3 /4) r¬≤)/2|Simplify inside the absolute value:- (0.75 * ‚àö3 /4) r¬≤ + (‚àö3 /4) r¬≤ = [ (-0.75 + 1) * ‚àö3 /4 ] r¬≤ = (0.25 * ‚àö3 /4) r¬≤ = (‚àö3 /16) r¬≤Then, divide by 2:Area = |(‚àö3 /16 r¬≤)/2| = ‚àö3 /32 r¬≤So, the area is ‚àö3 /32 r¬≤, which is option D.Wait, but hold on. Let me check again because I might have messed up the shoelace formula.Alternatively, since triangle MDA is a right triangle with legs DA and DM, as I thought earlier.DA is 0.25r, DM is ‚àö3/4 r.Therefore, area is (0.25r * ‚àö3/4 r)/2.Wait, no, no, hold on. If it's a right triangle, area is (base * height)/2, where base and height are the legs.So, base = DA = 0.25r, height = DM = ‚àö3/4 r.Therefore, area = (0.25r * ‚àö3/4 r)/2? Wait, no, no, no, that's not right.Wait, no, in a right triangle, the two legs are perpendicular, so the area is simply (leg1 * leg2)/2.So, leg1 = DA = 0.25r, leg2 = DM = ‚àö3/4 r.Therefore, area = (0.25r * ‚àö3/4 r)/2? Wait, no, that's three divisions by 2.Wait, no, it's (0.25r * ‚àö3/4 r)/2.Wait, 0.25 is 1/4, ‚àö3/4 is ‚àö3/4.So, 1/4 * ‚àö3/4 = ‚àö3 /16.Then, multiply by r¬≤, and divide by 2: ‚àö3 /16 r¬≤ /2 = ‚àö3 /32 r¬≤.So, same result as before.Therefore, the area is ‚àö3 /32 r¬≤, which is option D.Wait, but let me think again.Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the area using vectors or coordinate geometry.But I think the shoelace formula and the right triangle approach both give me the same answer, so I can be confident that it's ‚àö3 /32 r¬≤.Therefore, the answer should be option D.**Final Answer**boxed{D}"},{"question":"Compute the smallest base-10 positive integer greater than 5 that is a palindrome when written in both base 2 and 4.","answer":"First, I need to find the smallest base-10 integer greater than 5 that is a palindrome in both base 2 and base 4.I'll start by listing numbers greater than 5 and check their representations in base 2 and base 4.For each number, I'll convert it to base 2 and base 4, then check if both representations are palindromes.A palindrome reads the same forwards and backwards, so I'll compare the first and last digits, then the second and second-last, and so on.I'll continue this process until I find the smallest number that meets both conditions."},{"question":"Let the sequence {a_n} be a geometric sequence with the first term as 1 and the common ratio as -2.

Both Edward and the arrow are moving, so I need to model their positions as functions of time and find when they meet. Then, using that time, I can find the arrow's velocity.First, let's define some variables:- Let t be the time in seconds after the arrow is shot.- The initial position of Edward is 1,875 feet from the prison. So, his position as a function of time will be his initial position plus the distance he runs.- The arrow starts at the prison, so its initial position is 0 feet. Its position will be the distance it travels before hitting Edward.Since both are moving, their positions as functions of time should be equal at the time of impact.Let me write down the equations for their positions.Starting with Edward. He starts from rest and accelerates at 1 ft/s¬≤. So, his position as a function of time is given by the equation for constant acceleration:( x_E(t) = x_{E0} + v_{E0} t + frac{1}{2} a_E t^2 )Here, ( x_{E0} = 1875 ) feet, ( v_{E0} = 0 ) ft/s (since he starts from rest), and ( a_E = 1 ) ft/s¬≤. So, plugging in:( x_E(t) = 1875 + 0 + frac{1}{2} times 1 times t^2 = 1875 + frac{1}{2} t^2 )Okay, so Edward's position is ( 1875 + frac{1}{2} t^2 ) feet at time t.Now, for the arrow. It's shot with an initial velocity of 100 ft/s, but it's decelerating at 1 ft/s¬≤. So, the arrow's acceleration is -1 ft/s¬≤. Its position as a function of time is:( x_A(t) = x_{A0} + v_{A0} t + frac{1}{2} a_A t^2 )Here, ( x_{A0} = 0 ) feet, ( v_{A0} = 100 ) ft/s, and ( a_A = -1 ) ft/s¬≤. So, plugging in:( x_A(t) = 0 + 100 t + frac{1}{2} (-1) t^2 = 100 t - frac{1}{2} t^2 )So, the arrow's position is ( 100 t - frac{1}{2} t^2 ) feet at time t.At the moment of impact, their positions are equal, so:( x_E(t) = x_A(t) )Which gives:( 1875 + frac{1}{2} t^2 = 100 t - frac{1}{2} t^2 )Let me write that equation again:( 1875 + frac{1}{2} t^2 = 100 t - frac{1}{2} t^2 )Hmm, let's bring all terms to one side to solve for t.First, add ( frac{1}{2} t^2 ) to both sides:( 1875 + frac{1}{2} t^2 + frac{1}{2} t^2 = 100 t )Simplify the left side:( 1875 + t^2 = 100 t )Now, subtract 100 t from both sides:( t^2 - 100 t + 1875 = 0 )So, we have a quadratic equation in terms of t:( t^2 - 100 t + 1875 = 0 )I need to solve this quadratic equation for t. Let's use the quadratic formula:( t = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4 a c}}{2 a} )Here, a = 1, b = -100, c = 1875.Plugging in:( t = frac{-(-100) pm sqrt{(-100)^2 - 4 times 1 times 1875}}{2 times 1} )Simplify:( t = frac{100 pm sqrt{10000 - 7500}}{2} )Calculate the discriminant:10000 - 7500 = 2500So,( t = frac{100 pm sqrt{2500}}{2} )( sqrt{2500} = 50 ), so:( t = frac{100 pm 50}{2} )So, two solutions:1. ( t = frac{100 + 50}{2} = frac{150}{2} = 75 ) seconds2. ( t = frac{100 - 50}{2} = frac{50}{2} = 25 ) secondsHmm, so t = 75 or t = 25. Which one is the correct time of impact?Well, let's think about the motion. The arrow is decelerating, so its speed decreases over time. Edward is accelerating, so his speed increases over time. The arrow is faster initially, so it might catch up with Edward at t = 25 seconds. But wait, let's check what happens at t = 75.Wait, at t = 75, the arrow's velocity would be:( v_A(t) = v_{A0} + a_A t = 100 + (-1)(75) = 25 ) ft/sEdward's velocity at t = 75 is:( v_E(t) = v_{E0} + a_E t = 0 + 1 times 75 = 75 ) ft/sSo, at t = 75, Edward is moving faster than the arrow. But since the arrow is decelerating and Edward is accelerating, it's possible that the arrow catches up with Edward before t = 75, then Edward overtakes the arrow again? Wait, but the arrow is decelerating, so its speed is decreasing, and Edward is accelerating, so his speed is increasing. So, maybe the arrow hits Edward at t = 25, and then Edward keeps moving away, and the arrow eventually stops.Wait, let's check the positions at t = 25 and t = 75.At t = 25:Edward's position: 1875 + 0.5*(25)^2 = 1875 + 0.5*625 = 1875 + 312.5 = 2187.5 feetArrow's position: 100*25 - 0.5*(25)^2 = 2500 - 0.5*625 = 2500 - 312.5 = 2187.5 feetSo, they meet at 2187.5 feet at t = 25.At t = 75:Edward's position: 1875 + 0.5*(75)^2 = 1875 + 0.5*5625 = 1875 + 2812.5 = 4687.5 feetArrow's position: 100*75 - 0.5*(75)^2 = 7500 - 0.5*5625 = 7500 - 2812.5 = 4687.5 feetSo, they meet again at 4687.5 feet at t = 75.But wait, the arrow is decelerating, so at t = 75, its velocity is 25 ft/s, as I calculated earlier. But Edward is moving at 75 ft/s at that time. So, the arrow is moving slower than Edward, but they meet again. How is that possible?Wait, perhaps the arrow passes Edward at t = 25, keeps moving forward, but since it's decelerating, it slows down, and Edward, who is accelerating, catches up again at t = 75.But the problem says that the arrow does hit Edward. So, does it hit him once or twice? Hmm, the problem says \\"it does hit Edward,\\" so maybe it's only once? Or maybe it's the first time, which is at t = 25.But why does the quadratic equation give two solutions? Maybe both are valid, but we have to consider the physical meaning.Wait, let's think about the arrow's motion. The arrow is shot with 100 ft/s, decelerating at 1 ft/s¬≤. So, its velocity decreases by 1 ft/s each second. So, at t = 100 seconds, its velocity would be zero, and it would start falling back. But in this case, the arrow hits Edward at t = 25 and t = 75. So, between t = 25 and t = 75, the arrow is still moving forward, just slower, and Edward is moving faster, so Edward catches up again.But the problem says \\"the guard fired an arrow... and it does hit Edward.\\" So, it's implied that the arrow hits Edward once, but according to the math, it's hitting him twice. Maybe the arrow hits him on the way out and then again on the way back? But the arrow is only decelerating, not reversing direction. Wait, no, the arrow is decelerating but still moving forward until its velocity becomes zero. So, after t = 100 seconds, it would start moving backward. But in this case, the arrow hits Edward at t = 25 and t = 75, both while moving forward.Wait, but at t = 75, the arrow is moving at 25 ft/s, which is still forward. So, Edward is moving at 75 ft/s, which is faster, so he catches up again. So, the arrow is moving forward, Edward is moving forward, and Edward catches up to the arrow again.But in the problem statement, it says \\"Edward stopped to rest... and was spotted by a guard... The guard fired an arrow... At the same time, Edward started running away...\\" So, Edward is running away, and the arrow is fired towards him. So, the arrow is moving towards Edward, who is moving away.Wait, hold on, maybe I have a misunderstanding here.Wait, is Edward moving away from the prison, so the arrow is moving towards him, but since Edward is accelerating, he might be moving away faster than the arrow is approaching. So, maybe the arrow can only hit him once, before Edward gets too far away.Wait, but according to the equations, they meet twice. Hmm.Wait, perhaps the arrow is moving towards Edward, but since Edward is moving away, the arrow needs to cover the distance between them, which is increasing because Edward is accelerating. So, maybe the arrow can only catch up once, but according to the math, it's catching up twice.Wait, let me think about the relative motion.Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in setting up the equations.Wait, let me double-check the equations.Edward's position: starting at 1875 feet, accelerating at 1 ft/s¬≤.So, ( x_E(t) = 1875 + 0.5 * 1 * t^2 = 1875 + 0.5 t^2 ). That seems correct.Arrow's position: starting at 0, initial velocity 100 ft/s, decelerating at 1 ft/s¬≤.So, ( x_A(t) = 100 t - 0.5 * 1 * t^2 = 100 t - 0.5 t^2 ). That also seems correct.Setting them equal:( 1875 + 0.5 t^2 = 100 t - 0.5 t^2 )Bringing all terms to one side:( 1875 + 0.5 t^2 + 0.5 t^2 - 100 t = 0 )Simplifies to:( t^2 - 100 t + 1875 = 0 )Which is correct.So, the quadratic equation gives two solutions, t = 25 and t = 75.So, the arrow hits Edward at t = 25 and t = 75.But the problem says \\"it does hit Edward,\\" which is a bit ambiguous. It could mean that it hits him once, but the equations show two times. So, perhaps the arrow is fired, hits Edward at t = 25, then continues moving, slows down, and Edward, who is accelerating, catches up again at t = 75.But in reality, once the arrow hits Edward, it would probably stop or change its motion, so maybe only the first impact is valid. But the problem doesn't specify that. It just says \\"it does hit Edward,\\" so maybe both are possible, but we need to find the velocity at impact.Wait, but the problem is asking for the speed at the moment of impact. So, if there are two impacts, we need to know which one they are referring to.Wait, let's think about the arrow's velocity at t = 25 and t = 75.At t = 25, the arrow's velocity is:( v_A = 100 - 1 * 25 = 75 ) ft/sAt t = 75, the arrow's velocity is:( v_A = 100 - 1 * 75 = 25 ) ft/sSo, the arrow is moving at 75 ft/s when it first hits Edward, and then at 25 ft/s when it hits him again.But does the arrow hit him again? Because after t = 25, the arrow is moving forward but decelerating, while Edward is moving forward and accelerating. So, Edward might catch up again.But in reality, once the arrow hits Edward, it might not continue moving. So, perhaps only the first impact is valid, at t = 25.But the problem doesn't specify, so maybe we need to consider both.Wait, let's see. The problem says \\"the guard fired an arrow... and it does hit Edward.\\" It doesn't specify whether it's the first or second hit. So, perhaps we need to find both velocities, but the problem is asking for \\"how fast was the arrow moving at the moment of impact,\\" which is a single answer.Wait, maybe I need to consider the arrow's velocity at both times and see which one makes sense.Alternatively, perhaps the arrow only hits Edward once because after t = 25, the arrow is moving slower than Edward, so Edward is moving away, and the arrow can't catch up again.Wait, but according to the equations, they meet again at t = 75.Wait, perhaps the arrow is moving towards Edward, who is moving away. So, the distance between them is initially 1875 feet. The arrow is moving towards Edward with decreasing speed, while Edward is moving away with increasing speed. So, the arrow might catch up once, but after that, Edward is moving away faster, so the arrow can't catch up again.Wait, but in the equations, they meet again at t = 75. So, maybe the arrow passes Edward at t = 25, continues moving forward, slows down, and Edward, who is accelerating, catches up again at t = 75.But in reality, once the arrow hits Edward, it would probably stop, so the second impact might not happen.Hmm, the problem is a bit ambiguous. It just says \\"it does hit Edward,\\" so maybe it's referring to the first impact, which is at t = 25, when the arrow is moving at 75 ft/s.Alternatively, maybe both impacts are valid, but the problem is asking for the speed at impact, so perhaps both 75 ft/s and 25 ft/s are possible. But the problem is asking for a single answer.Wait, let me think again. The arrow is fired at t = 0, and Edward starts running at t = 0. So, the arrow is moving towards Edward, who is moving away. The arrow is decelerating, so its speed is decreasing, while Edward is accelerating, so his speed is increasing.At t = 25, the arrow catches up to Edward, hits him, and then continues moving forward, but slower. Edward, now hit, might stop or continue running. The problem doesn't specify, so maybe Edward keeps running. So, the arrow, now moving at 75 ft/s, continues forward, but since it's decelerating, it slows down further, while Edward, moving at 25 ft/s at that point, continues to accelerate.Wait, no, at t = 25, Edward's velocity is:( v_E = 0 + 1 * 25 = 25 ) ft/sSo, at t = 25, Edward is moving at 25 ft/s, while the arrow is moving at 75 ft/s. So, the arrow is still faster, so it continues moving ahead, but decelerating.Edward, moving at 25 ft/s, continues to accelerate, so his speed increases beyond 25 ft/s.At some point, Edward's speed will surpass the arrow's speed, so Edward will start to catch up.Wait, but the arrow's speed is decreasing, so at t = 75, the arrow is moving at 25 ft/s, and Edward is moving at 75 ft/s.So, Edward catches up to the arrow again at t = 75.But in reality, once the arrow hits Edward at t = 25, it might have stopped, so the second impact might not happen. But the problem doesn't specify that, so maybe we have to consider both.But the problem is asking for \\"how fast was the arrow moving at the moment of impact.\\" So, it might be referring to the first impact, which is at t = 25, when the arrow is moving at 75 ft/s.Alternatively, maybe both impacts are considered, but the problem is asking for the speed, so both 75 and 25 ft/s are possible. But the problem is expecting a single answer, so I think it's referring to the first impact.Wait, but let me think again. If the arrow is moving towards Edward, who is moving away, the arrow might only hit Edward once, because after that, Edward is moving faster, so the arrow can't catch up again.Wait, but according to the equations, they meet again at t = 75. So, perhaps the arrow passes Edward at t = 25, continues moving forward, slows down, and Edward, accelerating, catches up again at t = 75.So, in that case, the arrow is moving at 75 ft/s when it first hits Edward, and then at 25 ft/s when Edward hits it again.But the problem says \\"the guard fired an arrow... and it does hit Edward.\\" So, maybe the arrow hits Edward once, at t = 25, and that's it.Alternatively, maybe the arrow is moving towards Edward, who is moving away, so the arrow is moving towards increasing x, while Edward is moving towards increasing x as well. So, the arrow is moving in the same direction as Edward, but starting from behind.Wait, hold on. Wait, the prison is at position 0, Edward is at 1875 feet. So, the arrow is fired from 0 towards Edward at 1875 feet, who is moving away. So, the arrow is moving in the positive x direction, same as Edward.So, the arrow is moving towards Edward, who is moving away. So, the arrow needs to cover the distance between them, which is increasing because Edward is accelerating.So, the arrow is moving forward, decelerating, while Edward is moving forward, accelerating.So, the arrow might catch up to Edward once, at t = 25, hit him, and then continue moving forward, but slower, while Edward keeps moving forward, faster.So, the arrow is moving at 75 ft/s when it hits Edward at t = 25, and then continues moving forward, but decelerating, while Edward is moving forward, accelerating.So, the arrow's position after t = 25 is still moving forward, but slower, while Edward is moving forward faster. So, the arrow is moving away from the prison, same as Edward, but slower.Wait, but after t = 25, the arrow is moving at 75 ft/s, and Edward is moving at 25 ft/s. Wait, no, at t = 25, the arrow is moving at 75 ft/s, and Edward is moving at 25 ft/s. So, the arrow is moving faster than Edward at that point, so it continues moving ahead.Wait, but Edward is accelerating, so his speed increases beyond 25 ft/s. So, at t = 50, Edward is moving at 50 ft/s, and the arrow is moving at 100 - 50 = 50 ft/s. So, at t = 50, both are moving at 50 ft/s.Wait, so at t = 50, their speeds are equal. So, the arrow is moving at 50 ft/s, Edward is moving at 50 ft/s. So, the distance between them is?At t = 50, Edward's position is 1875 + 0.5*(50)^2 = 1875 + 1250 = 3125 feet.Arrow's position is 100*50 - 0.5*(50)^2 = 5000 - 1250 = 3750 feet.So, the arrow is ahead of Edward by 3750 - 3125 = 625 feet at t = 50.So, the arrow is moving ahead, but slower, while Edward is catching up.Wait, so at t = 50, the arrow is moving at 50 ft/s, Edward at 50 ft/s, so the distance between them is 625 feet, and Edward is not catching up because their speeds are equal.Wait, but after t = 50, Edward's speed increases beyond 50 ft/s, while the arrow's speed decreases below 50 ft/s.So, after t = 50, Edward is moving faster than the arrow, so he starts to catch up.So, at t = 75, Edward's speed is 75 ft/s, arrow's speed is 25 ft/s, and their positions are both at 4687.5 feet.So, Edward catches up to the arrow again at t = 75.So, in this case, the arrow is moving at 25 ft/s when Edward hits it again.But in reality, once the arrow hits Edward at t = 25, it might have stopped, so the second impact might not happen. But the problem doesn't specify that, so perhaps both impacts are considered.But the problem is asking for \\"how fast was the arrow moving at the moment of impact.\\" So, if there are two impacts, the arrow's speed would be different each time.But the problem is probably expecting a single answer, so maybe it's referring to the first impact.Alternatively, maybe I need to consider both and see which one makes sense.Wait, let me think about the arrow's velocity.At t = 25, the arrow is moving at 75 ft/s, which is still quite fast, and Edward is moving at 25 ft/s. So, the arrow hits Edward, who is moving slower, so the arrow continues moving forward.At t = 75, the arrow is moving at 25 ft/s, and Edward is moving at 75 ft/s. So, Edward hits the arrow from behind, moving faster.But in the problem statement, it's the guard who fires the arrow, so the arrow is moving towards Edward, who is moving away. So, the arrow is fired from behind Edward, moving towards him, but Edward is moving away.So, the arrow is moving towards Edward, who is moving away, so the arrow is moving in the same direction as Edward, but starting from behind.So, the arrow is moving towards Edward, but Edward is moving away, so the arrow needs to cover the distance between them, which is increasing because Edward is accelerating.So, the arrow might catch up to Edward once, at t = 25, and then, since the arrow is decelerating and Edward is accelerating, Edward might catch up to the arrow again at t = 75.But in reality, once the arrow hits Edward at t = 25, it would probably stop or change direction, so the second impact might not happen.But the problem doesn't specify that, so maybe both are valid.But since the problem is asking for the speed at impact, and it's a single answer, perhaps it's referring to the first impact, which is at t = 25, when the arrow is moving at 75 ft/s.Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the arrow moving towards Edward, so the first impact is when the arrow hits Edward, and the second impact is when Edward hits the arrow again, but that seems less likely.Wait, but in the problem statement, it's the guard who fires the arrow, so the arrow is moving towards Edward, who is moving away. So, the arrow is moving in the same direction as Edward, but starting from behind.So, the arrow is moving towards Edward, who is moving away, so the arrow needs to cover the distance between them, which is increasing because Edward is accelerating.So, the arrow is moving towards Edward, but Edward is moving away, so the arrow might only hit Edward once, at t = 25, because after that, the arrow is moving slower, and Edward is moving faster, so the arrow can't catch up again.Wait, but according to the equations, they meet again at t = 75. So, maybe the arrow passes Edward at t = 25, continues moving forward, and Edward, moving faster, catches up again at t = 75.But in reality, once the arrow hits Edward, it might stop, so the second impact might not happen.But the problem doesn't specify, so maybe we have to consider both.But the problem is asking for \\"how fast was the arrow moving at the moment of impact.\\" So, if it's the first impact, it's 75 ft/s, if it's the second impact, it's 25 ft/s.But since the problem says \\"the guard fired an arrow... and it does hit Edward,\\" it's more likely referring to the first impact, when the arrow hits Edward while moving towards him.So, I think the answer is 75 ft/s.Wait, but let me double-check.At t = 25, the arrow is moving at 75 ft/s, which is still faster than Edward's 25 ft/s. So, the arrow hits Edward and continues moving forward.At t = 75, the arrow is moving at 25 ft/s, while Edward is moving at 75 ft/s. So, Edward hits the arrow from behind.But in the problem statement, it's the guard who fires the arrow, so the arrow is moving towards Edward, who is moving away. So, the first impact is when the arrow hits Edward, and the second impact is when Edward hits the arrow again from behind.But the problem is asking for the speed of the arrow at the moment of impact, so if it's the first impact, it's 75 ft/s, if it's the second, it's 25 ft/s.But the problem says \\"the arrow does hit Edward,\\" which is in the past tense, so maybe it's referring to the first impact.Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering both impacts, but the answer is the speed at the first impact, which is 75 ft/s.But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should calculate both and see which one makes sense.Wait, let me think about the arrow's velocity.At t = 25, the arrow's velocity is 75 ft/s, moving towards Edward, who is moving away at 25 ft/s.At t = 75, the arrow's velocity is 25 ft/s, moving towards Edward, who is moving away at 75 ft/s.So, in both cases, the arrow is moving towards Edward, but in the second case, Edward is moving away faster.But in the first case, the arrow is moving faster than Edward, so it's catching up.In the second case, Edward is moving faster than the arrow, so he's catching up.So, both are valid, but the problem is asking for the speed at impact, so both are possible.But since the problem is asking for a single answer, and it's more likely referring to the first impact, I think the answer is 75 ft/s.But to be thorough, let me check the positions again.At t = 25, both are at 2187.5 feet.At t = 75, both are at 4687.5 feet.So, the arrow is moving forward, passes Edward at t = 25, continues moving forward, slows down, and Edward, accelerating, catches up again at t = 75.So, the arrow is moving at 25 ft/s when Edward hits it again.But in the problem statement, it's the guard who fires the arrow, so the arrow is moving towards Edward, who is moving away.So, the first impact is when the arrow hits Edward, and the second impact is when Edward hits the arrow again.But the problem is asking for the speed of the arrow at the moment of impact, so if it's the first impact, it's 75 ft/s, if it's the second, it's 25 ft/s.But since the problem says \\"the guard fired an arrow... and it does hit Edward,\\" it's more likely referring to the first impact.Therefore, the speed of the arrow at the moment of impact is 75 ft/s.Wait, but let me think again. The problem says \\"the guard fired an arrow... and it does hit Edward,\\" which is a bit ambiguous. It could mean that the arrow hits Edward once, but according to the equations, it hits him twice.But in reality, once the arrow hits Edward, it would probably stop, so the second impact wouldn't happen. So, maybe only the first impact is valid, at t = 25, with the arrow moving at 75 ft/s.Therefore, I think the answer is 75 ft/s.But wait, let me check the arrow's velocity at t = 25.Yes, ( v_A = 100 - 1*25 = 75 ) ft/s.And at t = 75, ( v_A = 100 - 1*75 = 25 ) ft/s.So, both are correct, but depending on which impact we're considering.But since the problem is asking for the speed at the moment of impact, and it's more likely referring to the first impact, I think the answer is 75 ft/s.But to be thorough, let me check if the arrow can actually hit Edward twice.At t = 25, the arrow hits Edward, moving at 75 ft/s, while Edward is moving at 25 ft/s. So, the arrow continues moving forward, but slower.At t = 50, the arrow is moving at 50 ft/s, Edward at 50 ft/s, so they are moving at the same speed, but the arrow is ahead.At t = 75, the arrow is moving at 25 ft/s, Edward at 75 ft/s, so Edward catches up.So, in reality, the arrow is moving towards Edward, hits him at t = 25, continues moving forward, but slower, and Edward, moving faster, catches up again at t = 75.So, both impacts are valid, but the problem is asking for the speed at impact, so both 75 and 25 ft/s are possible.But since the problem is asking for a single answer, and it's more likely referring to the first impact, I think the answer is 75 ft/s.But to be safe, maybe I should consider that the arrow is moving towards Edward, who is moving away, so the arrow can only hit him once, at t = 25, because after that, the arrow is moving slower, and Edward is moving faster, so the arrow can't catch up again.Therefore, the arrow hits Edward once, at t = 25, moving at 75 ft/s.So, the answer is 75 ft/s.**Final Answer**The arrow was moving at a speed of boxed{75} ft/s at the moment of impact."},{"question":"In a unit cube ( ABCD-A_{1}B_{1}C_{1}D_{1} ), points ( E, F, G ) are the midpoints of edges ( AA_{1}, C_{1}D_{1}, D_{1}A_{1} ) respectively.

Points E, F, G are the midpoints of edges AA‚ÇÅ, C‚ÇÅD‚ÇÅ, and D‚ÇÅA‚ÇÅ respectively. I need to find the distance from point B‚ÇÅ to the plane containing E, F, G. Hmm, okay, let me try to visualize this cube and figure out how to approach this.First, since it's a unit cube, all edges are 1 unit long. That should make calculations a bit simpler. Let me recall that in a cube, opposite edges are parallel and equal in length. The midpoints E, F, G are each halfway along their respective edges.Maybe I should assign coordinates to each of the cube's vertices to make this more concrete. Let me set up a coordinate system where point A is at the origin (0,0,0). Then, since it's a unit cube, the coordinates of the other points can be determined accordingly.So, let me list out the coordinates:- A: (0,0,0)- B: (1,0,0)- C: (1,1,0)- D: (0,1,0)- A‚ÇÅ: (0,0,1)- B‚ÇÅ: (1,0,1)- C‚ÇÅ: (1,1,1)- D‚ÇÅ: (0,1,1)Alright, that seems right. Now, let's find the coordinates of points E, F, G.Point E is the midpoint of AA‚ÇÅ. Since A is (0,0,0) and A‚ÇÅ is (0,0,1), the midpoint E will be the average of their coordinates. So, E = ((0+0)/2, (0+0)/2, (0+1)/2) = (0,0,0.5).Point F is the midpoint of C‚ÇÅD‚ÇÅ. C‚ÇÅ is (1,1,1) and D‚ÇÅ is (0,1,1). So, F = ((1+0)/2, (1+1)/2, (1+1)/2) = (0.5,1,1).Point G is the midpoint of D‚ÇÅA‚ÇÅ. D‚ÇÅ is (0,1,1) and A‚ÇÅ is (0,0,1). So, G = ((0+0)/2, (1+0)/2, (1+1)/2) = (0,0.5,1).Okay, so now I have the coordinates of E, F, G:- E: (0,0,0.5)- F: (0.5,1,1)- G: (0,0.5,1)Now, I need to find the equation of the plane containing these three points. Once I have the equation of the plane, I can use the formula for the distance from a point to a plane to find the distance from B‚ÇÅ to this plane.To find the equation of the plane, I can use the general plane equation: ax + by + cz + d = 0. Since the plane passes through points E, F, G, I can substitute each of their coordinates into this equation to get a system of equations. Then, I can solve for a, b, c, d.Alternatively, another method is to find two vectors lying on the plane and compute the normal vector using the cross product. Then, use the normal vector to write the plane equation. Maybe this method is more straightforward.Let me try that. So, first, I'll find two vectors on the plane. Let's take vectors EF and EG.Vector EF is F - E = (0.5 - 0, 1 - 0, 1 - 0.5) = (0.5,1,0.5).Vector EG is G - E = (0 - 0, 0.5 - 0, 1 - 0.5) = (0,0.5,0.5).Now, the normal vector n to the plane can be found by taking the cross product of vectors EF and EG.Let me compute that cross product.EF = (0.5, 1, 0.5)EG = (0, 0.5, 0.5)The cross product n = EF √ó EG is calculated as:|i ¬†¬†j ¬†¬†k||0.5 1 ¬†¬†0.5||0 ¬†¬†0.5 0.5|So, determinant:i*(1*0.5 - 0.5*0.5) - j*(0.5*0.5 - 0*0.5) + k*(0.5*0.5 - 0*1)Compute each component:i: (1*0.5 - 0.5*0.5) = 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25j: -(0.5*0.5 - 0*0.5) = -(0.25 - 0) = -0.25k: (0.5*0.5 - 0*1) = 0.25 - 0 = 0.25So, n = (0.25, -0.25, 0.25)Hmm, okay. So, the normal vector is (0.25, -0.25, 0.25). I can also write this as (1, -1, 1) by multiplying each component by 4 to eliminate the decimals. Since the normal vector can be scaled, this won't affect the plane equation.So, the plane equation can be written as 1*(x - x‚ÇÄ) - 1*(y - y‚ÇÄ) + 1*(z - z‚ÇÄ) = 0, where (x‚ÇÄ, y‚ÇÄ, z‚ÇÄ) is a point on the plane. Let's use point E (0,0,0.5) as the point.Plugging into the equation:1*(x - 0) - 1*(y - 0) + 1*(z - 0.5) = 0Simplify:x - y + z - 0.5 = 0So, the plane equation is x - y + z = 0.5Let me verify this with points F and G to make sure.For point F: (0.5,1,1)0.5 - 1 + 1 = 0.5, which equals 0.5. Correct.For point G: (0,0.5,1)0 - 0.5 + 1 = 0.5, which also equals 0.5. Correct.Great, so the plane equation is x - y + z = 0.5.Now, I need to find the distance from point B‚ÇÅ to this plane. Point B‚ÇÅ has coordinates (1,0,1).The formula for the distance from a point (x‚ÇÅ, y‚ÇÅ, z‚ÇÅ) to the plane ax + by + cz + d = 0 is:Distance = |a*x‚ÇÅ + b*y‚ÇÅ + c*z‚ÇÅ + d| / sqrt(a¬≤ + b¬≤ + c¬≤)But in our plane equation, it's written as x - y + z = 0.5. Let me rearrange this to the standard form ax + by + cz + d = 0.x - y + z - 0.5 = 0So, a = 1, b = -1, c = 1, d = -0.5Wait, actually, in the standard form, it's ax + by + cz + d = 0, so here, it's 1*x + (-1)*y + 1*z + (-0.5) = 0. So, yes, a=1, b=-1, c=1, d=-0.5.But in the distance formula, it's |a*x‚ÇÅ + b*y‚ÇÅ + c*z‚ÇÅ + d| / sqrt(a¬≤ + b¬≤ + c¬≤). So, plugging in the values:Distance = |1*1 + (-1)*0 + 1*1 + (-0.5)| / sqrt(1¬≤ + (-1)¬≤ + 1¬≤)Compute numerator:1*1 = 1(-1)*0 = 01*1 = 1So, 1 + 0 + 1 - 0.5 = 1 + 1 - 0.5 = 2 - 0.5 = 1.5So, numerator is |1.5| = 1.5Denominator: sqrt(1 + 1 + 1) = sqrt(3)So, distance = 1.5 / sqrt(3)Simplify this:1.5 is 3/2, so 3/(2*sqrt(3)) = (sqrt(3)/2) after rationalizing.Wait, let me check:3/(2*sqrt(3)) = (3*sqrt(3))/(2*3) = sqrt(3)/2Yes, that's correct.So, the distance from B‚ÇÅ to the plane is sqrt(3)/2.Wait, but hold on. Let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I might have messed up signs or something.So, plane equation: x - y + z = 0.5, which is x - y + z - 0.5 = 0.Point B‚ÇÅ: (1,0,1)Compute a*x + b*y + c*z + d:1*1 + (-1)*0 + 1*1 + (-0.5) = 1 + 0 + 1 - 0.5 = 1.5Absolute value: 1.5Divide by sqrt(1 + 1 + 1) = sqrt(3)So, 1.5 / sqrt(3) = (3/2)/sqrt(3) = (3)/(2*sqrt(3)) = sqrt(3)/2Yes, that seems correct.Alternatively, I can think about whether this answer makes sense. Since it's a unit cube, the maximum distance between two points is sqrt(3), so sqrt(3)/2 is about 0.866, which is less than 1, which seems reasonable.Alternatively, maybe I can approach this problem using vectors or parametric equations, but I think the method I used is solid.Wait, another way to think about it is to find the parametric equation of the line from B‚ÇÅ perpendicular to the plane and find its intersection with the plane, then compute the distance between B‚ÇÅ and that intersection point.But that might be more involved, but let me try it to confirm.So, the direction vector of the line perpendicular to the plane is the normal vector of the plane, which is (1, -1, 1). So, parametric equations of the line starting at B‚ÇÅ(1,0,1) would be:x = 1 + t*1y = 0 + t*(-1)z = 1 + t*1So, x = 1 + t, y = -t, z = 1 + tNow, this line intersects the plane x - y + z = 0.5. Let's substitute x, y, z from the parametric equations into the plane equation.(1 + t) - (-t) + (1 + t) = 0.5Simplify:1 + t + t + 1 + t = 0.5Combine like terms:1 + 1 + t + t + t = 0.52 + 3t = 0.5Subtract 2:3t = 0.5 - 2 = -1.5So, t = -1.5 / 3 = -0.5So, t = -0.5Therefore, the intersection point is:x = 1 + (-0.5) = 0.5y = -(-0.5) = 0.5z = 1 + (-0.5) = 0.5So, the intersection point is (0.5, 0.5, 0.5)Now, compute the distance between B‚ÇÅ(1,0,1) and (0.5,0.5,0.5)Use the distance formula:sqrt[(1 - 0.5)^2 + (0 - 0.5)^2 + (1 - 0.5)^2]Compute each term:(0.5)^2 = 0.25(-0.5)^2 = 0.25(0.5)^2 = 0.25So, sqrt[0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25] = sqrt[0.75] = sqrt(3/4) = (sqrt(3))/2Which is the same result as before. So, that confirms the distance is sqrt(3)/2.Therefore, I'm confident that the distance from point B‚ÇÅ to the plane EFG is sqrt(3)/2.**Final Answer**The distance from point ( B_{1} ) to the plane containing points ( E, F, G ) is boxed{dfrac{sqrt{3}}{2}}."},{"question":"In the diagram, some of the hexagons are shaded. What fraction of all of the hexagons are shaded?(A) (frac{1}{2})(D) (frac{1}{3})(B) (frac{5}{9})(C) (frac{4}{5})(E) (frac{5}{6})![Diagram of hexagons with some shaded](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_04_20_6ed09463f225f8ba1f07g-026.jpg?height=303&width=296&top_left_y=835&top_left_x=1294)","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to figure out what fraction of all the hexagons are shaded in a given diagram. The options are (A) 1/2, (D) 1/3, (B) 5/9, (C) 4/5, and (E) 5/6. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, since I can't see the diagram, I need to rely on the description. The problem mentions a diagram with some hexagons shaded, so I imagine it's a tessellation of hexagons, maybe arranged in a honeycomb pattern. Often, these kinds of problems have a symmetrical arrangement, which might make counting easier.I should probably start by trying to visualize or sketch a similar diagram. Maybe it's a grid of hexagons with some shaded in a repeating pattern. If I can figure out the total number of hexagons and the number of shaded ones, I can compute the fraction.Wait, but without seeing the exact diagram, this might be tricky. Maybe I can think of common fractions and see which one makes sense. The options are 1/2, 1/3, 5/9, 4/5, and 5/6. These are all fractions with denominators 2, 3, 5, 6, and 9. So, the total number of hexagons is likely a multiple of these denominators.Let me consider the simplest case. If the diagram is a small arrangement, maybe 2 hexagons, but that would make the fraction either 1/2 or 1, which isn't an option. If it's 3 hexagons, maybe 1 is shaded, giving 1/3, which is option D. Alternatively, if it's 6 hexagons, maybe 5 are shaded, which would be 5/6, option E.But wait, hexagons in a tessellation usually form a larger grid, so maybe it's a 3x3 arrangement? That would give 9 hexagons. If 5 are shaded, that would be 5/9, which is option B. Alternatively, if it's a 5x5 grid, but that seems too large for the given options.Hmm, maybe it's a hexagonal grid with multiple layers. The number of hexagons in a hexagonal grid can be calculated using the formula 1 + 6 + 12 + ... for each layer. But that might complicate things.Alternatively, perhaps the diagram is a simple 2x2 arrangement, but that would only give 4 hexagons. If 2 are shaded, that's 1/2, which is option A. But I don't know if it's 2x2.Wait, maybe the diagram is a larger grid, like 3x3, which would have 9 hexagons. If 5 are shaded, that's 5/9. Alternatively, if it's 6 hexagons in a row, maybe 5 are shaded, giving 5/6.But without seeing the diagram, it's hard to be sure. Maybe I can think of common fractions used in such problems. 1/2 is a common fraction, but 5/9 is also a possibility.Alternatively, perhaps the diagram is a star made of hexagons, with some shaded. Maybe the center is shaded, and some others. If the center is one hexagon and the surrounding ones are six, making a total of seven. If the center and two others are shaded, that would be 3/7, which isn't an option. Hmm.Wait, maybe it's a tessellation with a repeating pattern. For example, every other hexagon is shaded, which would give 1/2. But that's option A.Alternatively, maybe every third hexagon is shaded, giving 1/3, option D.But I think the most common fraction in such problems, especially with hexagons, is 1/2 or 1/3. But the options also include 5/9 and 5/6, which are more specific.Wait, maybe the diagram is a 3x3 grid of hexagons, which would have 9 hexagons in total. If 5 are shaded, that's 5/9, which is option B. That seems plausible.Alternatively, if it's a 6-hexagon arrangement, like a hexagon made up of 6 smaller hexagons, with one in the center. If the center is shaded, that's 1/6, but that's not an option. If the center and the surrounding ones are shaded, that's 7/7, which is 1, not an option.Wait, maybe it's a 5-hexagon arrangement, but that's not a standard tessellation.Alternatively, maybe it's a 4-hexagon arrangement, but again, not sure.Wait, another approach: if the fraction is 5/6, that suggests that only one hexagon is unshaded out of six. Maybe the diagram has six hexagons with one unshaded, making 5/6 shaded.Alternatively, if it's 5/9, that's a bit more complex. Maybe a 3x3 grid with 5 shaded.Hmm, I think I need to consider that the diagram is a standard one used in such problems. Maybe it's a tessellation with a specific pattern. For example, in a beehive, each hexagon has six neighbors. Maybe every other hexagon is shaded, but that would be 1/2.Alternatively, maybe the shading follows a checkerboard pattern, which in hexagons can result in 1/3 or 2/3 shaded.Wait, in a hexagonal grid, a checkerboard pattern can actually result in two different colorings, each with 1/3 of the hexagons. So maybe 1/3 is shaded, which is option D.But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again.If the diagram is a tessellation with a repeating unit, say, a group of three hexagons where one is shaded, that would give 1/3. Alternatively, a group of six hexagons with two shaded, giving 1/3.Alternatively, maybe the diagram is a larger grid, like 3x3, which has 9 hexagons. If 5 are shaded, that's 5/9.But without seeing the diagram, it's hard to know. Maybe I can think of the options given. The options are 1/2, 1/3, 5/9, 4/5, 5/6.Let me think about which fraction is more likely. 5/9 is a less common fraction, but it's possible. 1/2 and 1/3 are more common.Wait, maybe the diagram is a hexagon divided into smaller hexagons. For example, a larger hexagon divided into 7 smaller hexagons (1 in the center and 6 around it). If the center is shaded, that's 1/7, which isn't an option. If the center and two others are shaded, that's 3/7, still not an option.Alternatively, maybe it's a tessellation of hexagons in a 2x2 arrangement, which would have 4 hexagons. If 2 are shaded, that's 1/2.Alternatively, maybe it's a 3x3 arrangement with 9 hexagons. If 5 are shaded, that's 5/9.Alternatively, maybe it's a 5-hexagon arrangement, but that's not standard.Wait, maybe the diagram is a hexagon divided into 6 smaller hexagons, with one in the center. If the center is shaded, that's 1/7, but again, not an option.Alternatively, maybe it's a tessellation where every third hexagon is shaded, giving 1/3.Wait, another thought: in a hexagonal grid, each hexagon has six neighbors. If you shade every other hexagon in a way that each shaded hexagon is surrounded by unshaded ones, you can get a 1/3 shading. Because each shaded hexagon would be surrounded by six unshaded, but each unshaded is shared among multiple shaded.Wait, actually, in a hexagonal grid, the maximum independent set is 1/3 of the hexagons. So maybe the fraction is 1/3, which is option D.But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's 1/2.Wait, let me think of a specific example. If you have a tessellation of hexagons, and you shade every other hexagon in a checkerboard pattern, you can actually get two different colorings, each with 1/3 of the hexagons. So maybe 1/3 is the fraction.Alternatively, if you shade every other row, you might get 1/2.But I think in a hexagonal grid, the maximum independent set is indeed 1/3, so maybe that's the fraction.Wait, but I'm not 100% sure. Let me try to visualize a small section.Imagine a hexagon divided into smaller hexagons. Let's say a 3x3 grid, which would have 7 hexagons in the center and 6 around it, making 13? Wait, no, a 3x3 grid of hexagons actually has 1 + 6 + 12 = 19 hexagons? Wait, no, that's for a hexagonal grid with layers.Wait, maybe it's simpler. Let me think of a 2x2 grid of hexagons, which would have 4 hexagons. If 2 are shaded, that's 1/2.Alternatively, a 3x3 grid, which is 9 hexagons. If 5 are shaded, that's 5/9.Wait, maybe the diagram is a 3x3 grid with 5 shaded. So the answer would be 5/9, option B.But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a 6-hexagon arrangement, with 5 shaded, giving 5/6.Wait, another approach: the options given are A:1/2, D:1/3, B:5/9, C:4/5, E:5/6.If I consider that 5/6 is a high fraction, meaning most are shaded. 4/5 is also high. 1/2 and 1/3 are lower. 5/9 is moderate.If the diagram is a tessellation with a repeating pattern where every other hexagon is shaded, that would be 1/2. But if it's a more complex pattern, maybe 5/9.Alternatively, maybe the diagram is a specific shape, like a hexagon divided into smaller hexagons, with some shaded.Wait, maybe it's a hexagon divided into 6 smaller hexagons, with one in the center. If the center is shaded, that's 1/7, but that's not an option. If two are shaded, that's 2/7, still not an option.Alternatively, maybe it's a tessellation where every third hexagon is shaded, giving 1/3.Wait, I think I need to make an educated guess here. Since the options include 5/9, which is a less common fraction, but possible, and 1/3, which is more common.Alternatively, maybe the diagram is a 3x3 grid with 5 shaded, giving 5/9.Wait, another thought: in a tessellation, if you shade every other hexagon in a row, and shift the shading in the next row, you can get a pattern where 1/2 are shaded. But in a hexagonal grid, this might result in a different fraction.Wait, maybe it's better to think of the hexagonal grid as a bipartite graph, where you can color the hexagons with two colors such that no two adjacent hexagons share the same color. In that case, the number of each color would be roughly equal, giving 1/2. But in a hexagonal grid, it's actually tripartite, meaning you can color it with three colors such that no two adjacent share the same color. So each color class would be 1/3 of the total.Therefore, if the shading corresponds to one color class, the fraction would be 1/3, which is option D.But wait, in a hexagonal grid, is it tripartite? Let me think. Yes, because each hexagon has six neighbors, and you can color them in three colors such that no two adjacent have the same color. So each color would be 1/3 of the total.Therefore, if the shaded hexagons correspond to one color class, the fraction is 1/3, option D.But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the shading is more than one color class, but the problem says \\"some of the hexagons are shaded,\\" so it could be one color class, which is 1/3.Alternatively, maybe it's two color classes, giving 2/3, but that's not an option.Wait, the options are 1/2, 1/3, 5/9, 4/5, 5/6.So 1/3 is an option, and 2/3 is not, so maybe it's 1/3.Alternatively, maybe the diagram is a specific shape, not a full tessellation, so the fraction is different.Wait, another approach: the problem mentions \\"all of the hexagons,\\" so it's the entire diagram. If the diagram is a specific shape, like a hexagon made up of smaller hexagons, the total number might be 7 (1 center, 6 around), or 19 (3 layers), etc.If it's 7 hexagons, and 5 are shaded, that's 5/7, which isn't an option. If it's 19, and 7 are shaded, that's 7/19, not an option.Alternatively, maybe it's a 3x3 grid, which is 9 hexagons. If 5 are shaded, that's 5/9.Wait, 5/9 is an option, so maybe that's the answer.Alternatively, maybe it's a 6-hexagon arrangement, with 5 shaded, giving 5/6.But without seeing the diagram, it's hard to know.Wait, another thought: the problem is from a test, and the options are given. Maybe the answer is 1/2, which is a common fraction.But I think the more accurate approach is to consider the hexagonal grid as a tripartite graph, leading to 1/3 shaded.Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should go with 1/3.Alternatively, maybe the diagram is a 3x3 grid with 5 shaded, giving 5/9.Wait, I think I need to make a decision here. Given the options, and considering the hexagonal grid can be colored with three colors, each being 1/3, I think the fraction is 1/3, option D.But wait, another thought: if the diagram is a tessellation where every other hexagon is shaded, that would be 1/2, but in a hexagonal grid, that's not possible because of the way the hexagons are arranged. You can't have a perfect alternation without overlap.Wait, actually, in a hexagonal grid, you can have a checkerboard pattern with three colors, each 1/3. So if only one color is shaded, that's 1/3.Therefore, I think the answer is D, 1/3.But wait, another angle: maybe the diagram is a specific shape, like a hexagon divided into smaller hexagons, with some shaded. For example, a hexagon divided into 7 smaller hexagons (1 center, 6 around). If the center is shaded, that's 1/7, not an option. If two are shaded, 2/7, still not an option.Alternatively, maybe it's a 2x2 grid of hexagons, which would have 4 hexagons. If 2 are shaded, that's 1/2.But I don't know.Wait, maybe the diagram is a hexagon with a star inside, shading certain parts. But without seeing it, it's hard.Alternatively, maybe the diagram is a tessellation where every third hexagon is shaded in a row, giving 1/3.Wait, I think I need to go with the tripartite graph idea, leading to 1/3, option D.But wait, another thought: if the diagram is a 3x3 grid of hexagons, which is 9 hexagons, and 5 are shaded, that's 5/9, which is option B.I think that's more likely because 3x3 grids are common in such problems.Wait, but how many hexagons are in a 3x3 grid? Actually, a 3x3 grid of hexagons would have 9 hexagons, arranged in 3 rows, each with 3 hexagons. If 5 are shaded, that's 5/9.Alternatively, maybe it's a 2x2 grid, 4 hexagons, 2 shaded, 1/2.But I think 3x3 is more likely.Wait, another way: if the diagram is a hexagon made up of smaller hexagons, like a larger hexagon divided into 7 smaller ones (1 center, 6 around). If 5 are shaded, that's 5/7, which isn't an option. If 4 are shaded, 4/7, still not an option.Alternatively, maybe it's a 4x4 grid, but that's 16 hexagons, which would lead to fractions like 8/16=1/2, but 1/2 is an option.Wait, but 4x4 grid of hexagons is 16, but in a tessellation, it's more complex.Wait, maybe it's a 2x3 grid, which would have 6 hexagons. If 5 are shaded, that's 5/6, option E.Alternatively, if it's 4 shaded, that's 4/6=2/3, not an option.Wait, 5/6 is an option, so maybe the diagram is a 2x3 grid with 5 shaded.But without seeing the diagram, it's hard to know.Wait, another approach: the options are A:1/2, D:1/3, B:5/9, C:4/5, E:5/6.If I consider that 5/6 is a high fraction, meaning most are shaded. 4/5 is also high. 1/2 and 1/3 are lower. 5/9 is moderate.If the diagram is a tessellation where most are shaded, maybe 5/6.Alternatively, if it's a 3x3 grid with 5 shaded, 5/9.But I think I need to make a choice here.Wait, another thought: in a tessellation, if you shade every other hexagon in a row, and shift the shading in the next row, you can get a pattern where 1/2 are shaded. But in a hexagonal grid, this might not be possible without overlap.Wait, actually, in a hexagonal grid, you can have a checkerboard pattern with three colors, each 1/3. So if you shade one color, that's 1/3.Alternatively, if you shade two colors, that's 2/3, but that's not an option.Wait, but the problem says \\"some of the hexagons are shaded,\\" so it could be one color class, which is 1/3.Therefore, I think the answer is D, 1/3.But wait, another angle: maybe the diagram is a specific shape, like a hexagon divided into smaller hexagons, with some shaded. For example, a hexagon divided into 6 smaller hexagons, with one in the center. If the center is shaded, that's 1/7, not an option. If two are shaded, 2/7, still not an option.Alternatively, maybe it's a 3x3 grid, 9 hexagons, 5 shaded, 5/9.Wait, I think I need to go with 5/9, option B, because it's a common fraction in such problems.But I'm not sure. I think I need to make a decision.Wait, another thought: if the diagram is a tessellation where every third hexagon is shaded, that's 1/3. But if it's a specific arrangement, like a 3x3 grid with 5 shaded, that's 5/9.I think I'll go with 5/9, option B."},{"question":"At the beginning of every period of British Literature, Mrs. Crabapple picks a random student to receive a crabapple as a gift, but really, as you might imagine, they are quite bitter and nasty.

It's the number of ways to choose 100 items out of 200, which is calculated as ( frac{200!}{100! times 100!} ). So, ( n = frac{200!}{(100!)^2} ). To find the prime factors of ( n ), I need to look at the prime factors in 200! and subtract the prime factors in each 100!.I remember that the exponent of a prime ( p ) in ( m! ) is given by the sum ( leftlfloor frac{m}{p} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{m}{p^2} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{m}{p^3} rightrfloor + ldots ) until ( p^k ) exceeds ( m ). So, for each prime, I can calculate how many times it appears in 200! and subtract twice the number of times it appears in 100!. If the result is greater than zero, then that prime is a factor of ( n ).Since the question is about two-digit primes, I can focus on primes between 10 and 99. But since the options are 61, 67, 83, and 97, I can just check each of these to see if they divide ( n ). The largest one that does will be the answer.Let me start with the largest prime given, which is 97. I need to check if 97 divides ( binom{200}{100} ). To do this, I'll compute the exponent of 97 in 200! and subtract twice the exponent of 97 in 100!.Calculating the exponent of 97 in 200!:- ( leftlfloor frac{200}{97} rightrfloor = 2 ) because 97*2=194, which is less than 200, and 97*3=291, which is more than 200.- ( leftlfloor frac{200}{97^2} rightrfloor = leftlfloor frac{200}{9409} rightrfloor = 0 ) since 9409 is way larger than 200.So, the exponent of 97 in 200! is 2.Now, the exponent of 97 in 100!:- ( leftlfloor frac{100}{97} rightrfloor = 1 ) because 97*1=97 is less than 100, and 97*2=194 is more than 100.- ( leftlfloor frac{100}{97^2} rightrfloor = 0 ) for the same reason as above.So, the exponent of 97 in 100! is 1.Therefore, the exponent of 97 in ( n = binom{200}{100} ) is 2 - 2*1 = 0. That means 97 does not divide ( n ). So, 97 is out of the running.Next, let's check 83. I'll do the same process.Exponent of 83 in 200!:- ( leftlfloor frac{200}{83} rightrfloor = 2 ) because 83*2=166 < 200, and 83*3=249 > 200.- ( leftlfloor frac{200}{83^2} rightrfloor = leftlfloor frac{200}{6889} rightrfloor = 0 ).So, exponent is 2.Exponent of 83 in 100!:- ( leftlfloor frac{100}{83} rightrfloor = 1 ) because 83*1=83 < 100, 83*2=166 > 100.- Higher powers are 0.So, exponent is 1.Thus, exponent in ( n ) is 2 - 2*1 = 0. So, 83 also doesn't divide ( n ). Hmm, moving on.Next is 67.Exponent of 67 in 200!:- ( leftlfloor frac{200}{67} rightrfloor = 2 ) since 67*2=134 < 200, 67*3=201 > 200.- ( leftlfloor frac{200}{67^2} rightrfloor = leftlfloor frac{200}{4489} rightrfloor = 0 ).So, exponent is 2.Exponent of 67 in 100!:- ( leftlfloor frac{100}{67} rightrfloor = 1 ) because 67*1=67 < 100, 67*2=134 > 100.- Higher powers are 0.So, exponent is 1.Therefore, exponent in ( n ) is 2 - 2*1 = 0. So, 67 doesn't divide ( n ) either. Hmm, this is interesting. So, 67 is out.Now, the last option is 61.Let me check 61.Exponent of 61 in 200!:- ( leftlfloor frac{200}{61} rightrfloor = 3 ) because 61*3=183 < 200, and 61*4=244 > 200.- ( leftlfloor frac{200}{61^2} rightrfloor = leftlfloor frac{200}{3721} rightrfloor = 0 ).So, exponent is 3.Exponent of 61 in 100!:- ( leftlfloor frac{100}{61} rightrfloor = 1 ) because 61*1=61 < 100, 61*2=122 > 100.- Higher powers are 0.So, exponent is 1.Therefore, exponent in ( n ) is 3 - 2*1 = 1. Since this is greater than 0, 61 divides ( n ).Wait, hold on. So, 61 is a prime factor of ( n ). But earlier, 83, 67, and 97 were not. So, that would make 61 the largest two-digit prime factor among the options given. But wait, is 61 the largest two-digit prime factor? Or is there a larger one not listed?Wait, the options are (A) 61, (B) 67, (C) 83, (D) 97. So, since 61 is the only one among these that divides ( n ), then 61 is the answer. But hold on, is there a possibility that another two-digit prime larger than 61 but smaller than 83, 67, or 97 is a factor? For example, primes like 73, 79, 89, etc. Maybe I should check those as well to make sure 61 is indeed the largest.Wait, but the options don't include those. So, perhaps the question is only giving these four options, so 61 is the answer. But just to be thorough, let me check a couple more primes.Let's check 73.Exponent of 73 in 200!:- ( leftlfloor frac{200}{73} rightrfloor = 2 ) because 73*2=146 < 200, 73*3=219 > 200.- ( leftlfloor frac{200}{73^2} rightrfloor = 0 ).So, exponent is 2.Exponent of 73 in 100!:- ( leftlfloor frac{100}{73} rightrfloor = 1 ).- Higher powers are 0.So, exponent is 1.Thus, exponent in ( n ) is 2 - 2*1 = 0. So, 73 doesn't divide ( n ).How about 79?Exponent of 79 in 200!:- ( leftlfloor frac{200}{79} rightrfloor = 2 ) since 79*2=158 < 200, 79*3=237 > 200.- ( leftlfloor frac{200}{79^2} rightrfloor = 0 ).So, exponent is 2.Exponent of 79 in 100!:- ( leftlfloor frac{100}{79} rightrfloor = 1 ).- Higher powers are 0.So, exponent is 1.Exponent in ( n ): 2 - 2*1 = 0. So, 79 is out.What about 89?Exponent of 89 in 200!:- ( leftlfloor frac{200}{89} rightrfloor = 2 ) because 89*2=178 < 200, 89*3=267 > 200.- ( leftlfloor frac{200}{89^2} rightrfloor = 0 ).So, exponent is 2.Exponent of 89 in 100!:- ( leftlfloor frac{100}{89} rightrfloor = 1 ).- Higher powers are 0.So, exponent is 1.Thus, exponent in ( n ): 2 - 2*1 = 0. So, 89 doesn't divide ( n ).How about 97? Wait, we already checked 97 earlier, and it didn't divide ( n ).So, moving on, 101 is a prime, but it's a three-digit prime, so we don't need to consider it.Wait, so from the two-digit primes above 61, like 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, none of them divide ( n ). So, 61 is indeed the largest two-digit prime factor of ( n ).But just to make sure, let me check 71 as well.Exponent of 71 in 200!:- ( leftlfloor frac{200}{71} rightrfloor = 2 ) because 71*2=142 < 200, 71*3=213 > 200.- ( leftlfloor frac{200}{71^2} rightrfloor = 0 ).So, exponent is 2.Exponent of 71 in 100!:- ( leftlfloor frac{100}{71} rightrfloor = 1 ).- Higher powers are 0.So, exponent is 1.Thus, exponent in ( n ): 2 - 2*1 = 0. So, 71 doesn't divide ( n ).Alright, so all the two-digit primes above 61 don't divide ( n ), so 61 must be the largest two-digit prime factor.Wait, but let me think again. Is there a prime between 61 and 100 that I might have missed? For example, 67, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97‚Äîthose are all the two-digit primes above 61. Since none of them divide ( n ), as we saw, 61 is indeed the largest.But just to be thorough, let me check another prime, say 59, which is less than 61, just to see if maybe I made a mistake earlier.Exponent of 59 in 200!:- ( leftlfloor frac{200}{59} rightrfloor = 3 ) because 59*3=177 < 200, 59*4=236 > 200.- ( leftlfloor frac{200}{59^2} rightrfloor = leftlfloor frac{200}{3481} rightrfloor = 0 ).So, exponent is 3.Exponent of 59 in 100!:- ( leftlfloor frac{100}{59} rightrfloor = 1 ).- Higher powers are 0.So, exponent is 1.Thus, exponent in ( n ): 3 - 2*1 = 1. So, 59 divides ( n ) as well. But since 61 is larger than 59, 61 is still the larger prime factor.Wait, but hold on a second. I just realized that 61 is a prime factor, but is there a prime between 61 and 83 that might also be a factor? For example, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83‚Äîall of which we checked and found that their exponents in ( n ) are zero. So, 61 is indeed the largest two-digit prime factor of ( n ).Therefore, the answer should be (A) 61.But wait, hold on. Let me double-check my calculations for 61. Maybe I made a mistake there.Exponent of 61 in 200!:- ( leftlfloor frac{200}{61} rightrfloor = 3 ) because 61*3=183 < 200, 61*4=244 > 200.- ( leftlfloor frac{200}{61^2} rightrfloor = leftlfloor frac{200}{3721} rightrfloor = 0 ).So, exponent is 3.Exponent of 61 in 100!:- ( leftlfloor frac{100}{61} rightrfloor = 1 ).- Higher powers are 0.So, exponent is 1.Thus, exponent in ( n ): 3 - 2*1 = 1. So, yes, 61 divides ( n ).Wait, but I just thought of something else. Is there a prime larger than 61 but less than 100 that divides ( n )? For example, 67, 71, etc. But as we saw earlier, all of them have exponents in ( n ) equal to zero. So, 61 is indeed the largest.But just to be absolutely sure, let me check another prime, say 53.Exponent of 53 in 200!:- ( leftlfloor frac{200}{53} rightrfloor = 3 ) because 53*3=159 < 200, 53*4=212 > 200.- ( leftlfloor frac{200}{53^2} rightrfloor = leftlfloor frac{200}{2809} rightrfloor = 0 ).So, exponent is 3.Exponent of 53 in 100!:- ( leftlfloor frac{100}{53} rightrfloor = 1 ).- Higher powers are 0.So, exponent is 1.Thus, exponent in ( n ): 3 - 2*1 = 1. So, 53 divides ( n ) as well, but it's smaller than 61.Wait, so 61 is larger than 53, so 61 is still the largest.Another thought: maybe I should check if 61 is indeed a prime factor. Let me think about the definition of binomial coefficients. ( binom{200}{100} ) is the number of ways to choose 100 elements from 200, which is a huge number. But primes can divide it if their exponents in the numerator are higher than in the denominator.Wait, but we already calculated that 61 appears 3 times in 200! and only once in each 100!, so 3 - 2 = 1. So, 61 divides ( n ) exactly once. So, yes, 61 is a prime factor.But just to make sure, let me think about another approach. Maybe using Legendre's formula, which is what I used earlier, but perhaps I can think about it differently.Legendre's formula tells us that the exponent of a prime ( p ) in ( n! ) is ( sum_{k=1}^{infty} leftlfloor frac{n}{p^k} rightrfloor ). So, for each prime, I calculate how many multiples of ( p ), ( p^2 ), ( p^3 ), etc., are in ( n! ).So, for 61 in 200!:- 200 / 61 = 3.278... so floor is 3.- 200 / 61^2 = 200 / 3721 ‚âà 0.053, floor is 0.So, total exponent is 3.In 100!:- 100 / 61 ‚âà 1.639, floor is 1.- 100 / 61^2 ‚âà 0.026, floor is 0.So, exponent is 1.Thus, in ( n = binom{200}{100} ), exponent is 3 - 2*1 = 1. So, yes, 61 divides ( n ).Another way to think about it: if a prime ( p ) is greater than 100, it can't divide ( 100! ), but it can divide ( 200! ). However, in our case, 61 is less than 100, so it appears in both 200! and 100!.Wait, but 61 is less than 100, so it's in both 200! and 100!. But since 61*3=183 is less than 200, it appears three times in 200!, but only once in each 100!. So, the difference is 3 - 2 = 1, so it divides ( n ) once.But for primes larger than 100, like 101, 103, etc., they only appear once in 200! and not at all in 100!, so their exponent in ( n ) would be 1 - 0 = 1, meaning they divide ( n ). But since the question is about two-digit primes, we don't need to consider those.Wait, but 97 is a two-digit prime, and it's less than 100. So, in 200!, it appears twice, and in 100!, it appears once. So, exponent in ( n ) is 2 - 2*1 = 0. So, 97 doesn't divide ( n ).Similarly, 83 appears twice in 200! and once in 100!, so exponent in ( n ) is 0.Same with 67: twice in 200!, once in 100!, so exponent in ( n ) is 0.But 61 appears three times in 200! and once in 100!, so exponent in ( n ) is 1.So, 61 is the only two-digit prime among the options given that divides ( n ). Therefore, the answer is 61.But just to make sure, let me check another prime, say 59, which is less than 61.Exponent of 59 in 200!:- 200 / 59 ‚âà 3.389, so floor is 3.- 200 / 59^2 ‚âà 0.053, floor is 0.So, exponent is 3.Exponent of 59 in 100!:- 100 / 59 ‚âà 1.694, floor is 1.- Higher powers are 0.So, exponent is 1.Thus, exponent in ( n ): 3 - 2*1 = 1. So, 59 divides ( n ) as well, but it's smaller than 61.Therefore, 61 is indeed the largest two-digit prime factor of ( n ).Wait, but hold on a second. I just thought of something. What about primes like 7, 11, 13, etc.? They are smaller two-digit primes, but since 61 is larger, it's still the largest.But just to confirm, let me check 73 again.Exponent of 73 in 200!:- 200 / 73 ‚âà 2.739, floor is 2.- 200 / 73^2 ‚âà 0.035, floor is 0.So, exponent is 2.Exponent of 73 in 100!:- 100 / 73 ‚âà 1.369, floor is 1.- Higher powers are 0.So, exponent is 1.Thus, exponent in ( n ): 2 - 2*1 = 0. So, 73 doesn't divide ( n ).Same with 79:- 200 / 79 ‚âà 2.531, floor is 2.- 200 / 79^2 ‚âà 0.031, floor is 0.Exponent in 200!: 2.Exponent in 100!:- 100 / 79 ‚âà 1.265, floor is 1.So, exponent is 1.Thus, exponent in ( n ): 2 - 2*1 = 0. So, 79 doesn't divide ( n ).Alright, so I think I've checked all the relevant primes. 61 is the largest two-digit prime that divides ( binom{200}{100} ). Therefore, the answer is 61.But wait, just to make sure, let me think about another approach. Maybe using the concept of Kummer's theorem or Lucas' theorem, but I think that might be overcomplicating things. Kummer's theorem tells us the number of carries when adding numbers in base p, which relates to the exponent of p in the binomial coefficient. But I think my initial approach using Legendre's formula is sufficient.Alternatively, I could think about the fact that for a prime ( p ), if ( p ) is greater than ( n/2 ), then it will appear exactly once in ( n! ). But in our case, 61 is less than 100, so that doesn't apply.Wait, but for primes greater than 100, like 101, 103, etc., they only appear once in 200! and not at all in 100!, so their exponent in ( n ) would be 1. But since we're only considering two-digit primes, those are out of the question.So, in conclusion, after checking all the two-digit primes above 61 and finding that none of them divide ( n ), and confirming that 61 does divide ( n ), I can confidently say that the largest two-digit prime factor of ( binom{200}{100} ) is 61.**Final Answer**boxed{A}"},{"question":"Simplify:1. 6( frac {8a^{3}}{125b^{3}})^{4} cdot( frac {8a^{-3}}{27b^{6}})^{-frac {1}{3}}2. (lg 2)cdot[(ln sqrt {e})^{-1}+log ,_{sqrt {2}}5]","answer":"Alright, so I have these two problems to simplify. Let me take them one by one. Starting with the first one: 1. (6left( frac {8a^{3}}{125b^{3}}right)^{4} cdotleft( frac {8a^{-3}}{27b^{6}}right)^{-frac {1}{3}})Hmm, okay. So, it's a product of two expressions, each raised to some power, and then multiplied by 6. Let me break this down step by step.First, let me look at the first part: (left( frac {8a^{3}}{125b^{3}}right)^{4}). I know that when you raise a fraction to a power, you can apply the exponent to both the numerator and the denominator. So, that would be:(frac{(8a^3)^4}{(125b^3)^4})Similarly, the second part is (left( frac {8a^{-3}}{27b^{6}}right)^{-frac {1}{3}}). Again, applying the exponent to both numerator and denominator:(frac{(8a^{-3})^{-1/3}}{(27b^6)^{-1/3}})Wait, but negative exponents can be tricky. Remember, a negative exponent means reciprocal. So, for the second part, maybe I can rewrite it as:(left( frac{8a^{-3}}{27b^6} right)^{-1/3} = left( frac{27b^6}{8a^{-3}} right)^{1/3})Which simplifies to:(frac{(27b^6)^{1/3}}{(8a^{-3})^{1/3}})Okay, that seems better. So, let me compute each part separately.Starting with the first fraction:(frac{(8a^3)^4}{(125b^3)^4})Compute numerator: (8^4 = 4096), and (a^{3 times 4} = a^{12}). So, numerator is (4096a^{12}).Denominator: (125^4). Hmm, 125 is 5^3, so 125^4 is (5^3)^4 = 5^{12}. Similarly, (b^{3 times 4} = b^{12}). So, denominator is (5^{12}b^{12}).So, the first part simplifies to:(frac{4096a^{12}}{5^{12}b^{12}})Now, moving on to the second part:(frac{(27b^6)^{1/3}}{(8a^{-3})^{1/3}})Compute numerator: 27 is 3^3, so (27)^{1/3} = 3. Then, (b^{6 times (1/3)} = b^2). So, numerator is (3b^2).Denominator: 8 is 2^3, so (8)^{1/3} = 2. Then, (a^{-3 times (1/3)} = a^{-1}). So, denominator is (2a^{-1}).So, the second part simplifies to:(frac{3b^2}{2a^{-1}})But (a^{-1}) is 1/a, so this becomes:(frac{3b^2}{2} cdot a = frac{3ab^2}{2})Wait, let me check that again. If the denominator is (2a^{-1}), that is (2 times frac{1}{a}), so the fraction is (frac{3b^2}{2 times frac{1}{a}} = frac{3b^2 times a}{2}), which is indeed (frac{3ab^2}{2}). Okay, that seems right.Now, putting it all together. The original expression is:6 multiplied by the first part multiplied by the second part.So, that is:6 times (frac{4096a^{12}}{5^{12}b^{12}}) times (frac{3ab^2}{2})Let me compute the constants first. 6 multiplied by 4096 is... let's see, 6*4096. 4096*6: 4000*6=24000, 96*6=576, so total is 24000+576=24576.Then, 24576 multiplied by 3 is... 24576*3. Let's compute that:24576 * 3:20000*3=600004000*3=12000500*3=150070*3=2106*3=18Adding them up: 60000 + 12000 = 72000; 72000 + 1500 = 73500; 73500 + 210 = 73710; 73710 + 18 = 73728.So, 24576 * 3 = 73728.Then, we have 73728 divided by 2, because the second fraction is multiplied by 1/2. So, 73728 / 2 = 36864.So, the constants simplify to 36864.Now, let's handle the variables.From the first part: (a^{12}), and from the second part: (a). So, (a^{12} times a = a^{13}).From the first part: (b^{12}) in the denominator, and from the second part: (b^2) in the numerator. So, (b^2 / b^{12} = b^{2 - 12} = b^{-10}), which is (1 / b^{10}).Putting it all together, we have:36864 times (frac{a^{13}}{b^{10}})But let me check if I can simplify 36864 with 5^{12} in the denominator. Wait, in the first fraction, the denominator was 5^{12}b^{12}, and the second fraction didn't have any 5s. So, actually, 5^{12} is still in the denominator.Wait, hold on. Let me retrace.Wait, in the first part, after simplifying, we had (frac{4096a^{12}}{5^{12}b^{12}}). Then, the second part was (frac{3ab^2}{2}). So, when we multiply them together, the constants are 4096 * 3 / 2, and the variables are a^{12} * a * b^2 / b^{12}.Wait, so perhaps I messed up the constants earlier.Wait, the original expression is 6 * (first part) * (second part). So, first part is (frac{4096a^{12}}{5^{12}b^{12}}), second part is (frac{3ab^2}{2}). So, multiplying all together:6 * (4096 / 5^{12}) * (3 / 2) * (a^{12} * a) * (b^2 / b^{12})So, constants: 6 * 4096 * 3 / (5^{12} * 2)Variables: a^{13} / b^{10}So, let's compute the constants step by step.First, 6 * 4096 = 24576.Then, 24576 * 3 = 73728.Denominator: 5^{12} * 2. 5^{12} is a huge number, but maybe we can leave it as is for now.So, constants: 73728 / (2 * 5^{12}) = 73728 / (2 * 244140625). Wait, 5^12 is 244140625.So, 73728 / (2 * 244140625) = 73728 / 488281250.Wait, let me compute that division.73728 divided by 488281250.Hmm, that's a small number. Let me compute 73728 / 488281250.First, note that 488281250 is 5^12 * 2, which is 244140625 * 2.Compute 73728 / 488281250.Let me see: 488281250 divided by 73728 is approximately... let's see, 488281250 / 73728 ‚âà 6625. So, 73728 / 488281250 ‚âà 1 / 6625.Wait, but maybe we can simplify the fraction 73728 / 488281250.Let's see if both numerator and denominator can be divided by 2: 73728 / 2 = 36864; 488281250 / 2 = 244140625.So, now it's 36864 / 244140625.Check if 36864 and 244140625 have any common factors.36864 is 2^12 * 3^2, because 36864 = 2^12 * 3^2. Let me check: 2^10 is 1024, 2^12 is 4096. 4096 * 9 = 36864. Yes, so 2^12 * 3^2.244140625 is 5^12, as 5^12 is 244140625.So, since 36864 is 2^12 * 3^2 and 244140625 is 5^12, they have no common factors. So, the fraction simplifies to 36864 / 244140625.So, the constants part is 36864 / 244140625, and variables are a^{13} / b^{10}.So, putting it all together, the expression simplifies to:(frac{36864 a^{13}}{244140625 b^{10}})Hmm, that seems pretty simplified, but maybe I can write 36864 and 244140625 in terms of exponents.Wait, 36864 is 2^12 * 3^2, as I had before, and 244140625 is 5^12.So, perhaps writing it as:(frac{2^{12} times 3^2 times a^{13}}{5^{12} times b^{10}})Alternatively, we can write this as:(left( frac{2 times 3}{5} right)^{12} times frac{a^{13}}{b^{10}})Wait, because 2^12 * 3^2 is (2*3)^2 * 2^10, but that might not help much.Alternatively, perhaps factor out some exponents.Wait, 36864 is 4096 * 9, which is 8^4 * 3^2.Similarly, 244140625 is 125^4, because 125^4 = (5^3)^4 = 5^12.So, 36864 / 244140625 = (8^4 * 3^2) / (125^4)So, the expression becomes:(frac{8^4 times 3^2 times a^{13}}{125^4 times b^{10}})But 8^4 is 4096, 3^2 is 9, so 4096*9=36864, which is where we started.Alternatively, maybe we can write this as:(left( frac{8}{125} right)^4 times frac{9 a^{13}}{b^{10}})But I don't know if that's any simpler.Alternatively, perhaps express 8 as 2^3 and 125 as 5^3:(left( frac{2^3}{5^3} right)^4 = frac{2^{12}}{5^{12}}), so yeah, same as before.I think that's as simplified as it can get unless we want to write it in decimal form, but that might not be helpful.So, perhaps the simplest form is (frac{36864 a^{13}}{244140625 b^{10}}), but maybe we can write it with exponents:(frac{2^{12} cdot 3^2 cdot a^{13}}{5^{12} cdot b^{10}})Alternatively, factor out exponents:(left( frac{2}{5} right)^{12} cdot 3^2 cdot a^{13} cdot b^{-10})But I think the first form is probably acceptable.Wait, but let me check if I made any mistakes in the constants earlier.Wait, 6 * (4096 / 5^12) * (3 / 2). So, 6 * 4096 = 24576; 24576 * 3 = 73728; 73728 / (2 * 5^12) = 73728 / (2 * 244140625) = 73728 / 488281250 = 36864 / 244140625.Yes, that seems correct.So, I think that's the simplified form.Moving on to the second problem:2. ((lg 2) cdot left[ (ln sqrt{e})^{-1} + log_{sqrt{2}} 5 right])Alright, so this is a product of lg 2 and a bracket containing two terms: (ln sqrt(e))^{-1} and log_{sqrt(2)} 5.Let me simplify each part step by step.First, let's compute (ln sqrt{e})^{-1}.We know that sqrt(e) is e^{1/2}, so ln(e^{1/2}) = (1/2) ln e = 1/2 * 1 = 1/2.Therefore, (ln sqrt{e})^{-1} = (1/2)^{-1} = 2.So, the first term inside the bracket is 2.Now, the second term is (log_{sqrt{2}} 5).Let me recall that (log_{a} b = frac{ln b}{ln a}), so maybe I can express this in terms of natural logs or common logs.Alternatively, since the base is sqrt(2), which is 2^{1/2}, perhaps I can use the change of base formula.Let me write (log_{sqrt{2}} 5 = frac{log_2 5}{log_2 sqrt{2}}).Compute (log_2 sqrt{2}): sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so log base 2 of 2^{1/2} is 1/2.Therefore, (log_{sqrt{2}} 5 = frac{log_2 5}{1/2} = 2 log_2 5).Alternatively, since (log_{2^{1/2}} 5 = frac{ln 5}{ln 2^{1/2}} = frac{ln 5}{(1/2) ln 2} = 2 frac{ln 5}{ln 2} = 2 log_2 5).Either way, we get 2 log_2 5.So, putting it back into the bracket:[2 + 2 log_2 5] = 2(1 + log_2 5)So, the entire expression is:(lg 2) * 2(1 + log_2 5)But lg 2 is log base 10 of 2, which is approximately 0.3010, but we can keep it as lg 2.So, let's write it as:2 lg 2 (1 + log_2 5)Alternatively, factor out the 2:2 lg 2 + 2 lg 2 log_2 5But maybe we can express log_2 5 in terms of lg 5 or something.Wait, log_2 5 = frac{lg 5}{lg 2}, by change of base formula.So, substituting back:2 lg 2 + 2 lg 2 * (lg 5 / lg 2) = 2 lg 2 + 2 lg 5Because lg 2 cancels out in the second term.So, 2 lg 2 + 2 lg 5 = 2(lg 2 + lg 5) = 2 lg (2 * 5) = 2 lg 10Since lg 10 is 1, because log base 10 of 10 is 1.Therefore, 2 * 1 = 2.Wait, so the entire expression simplifies to 2.Wow, that's nice.Let me recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake.Starting with:(ln sqrt{e})^{-1} = 2(log_{sqrt{2}} 5 = 2 log_2 5)So, the bracket becomes 2 + 2 log_2 5 = 2(1 + log_2 5)Multiply by lg 2:lg 2 * 2(1 + log_2 5) = 2 lg 2 (1 + log_2 5)Express log_2 5 as lg 5 / lg 2:2 lg 2 (1 + lg 5 / lg 2) = 2 lg 2 + 2 lg 5Which is 2(lg 2 + lg 5) = 2 lg 10 = 2*1 = 2.Yes, that seems correct.So, the second expression simplifies to 2.Alright, so summarizing:1. The first expression simplifies to (frac{36864 a^{13}}{244140625 b^{10}}), which can also be written as (frac{2^{12} cdot 3^2 cdot a^{13}}{5^{12} cdot b^{10}}).2. The second expression simplifies to 2.I think that's it.**Final Answer**1. (boxed{dfrac{36864 a^{13}}{244140625 b^{10}}})2. (boxed{2})"},{"question":"Given space vectors overrightarrow{a}=(-2,1,3) and overrightarrow{b}=(1,x,-1), and overrightarrow{a} is perpendicular to overrightarrow{b}, then x is equal to ______.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here with two vectors, a and b. Vector a is (-2, 1, 3) and vector b is (1, x, -1). The problem says that vector a is perpendicular to vector b, and I need to find the value of x. Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that if two vectors are perpendicular, their dot product is zero. Yeah, that sounds right. So, maybe I should calculate the dot product of vectors a and b and set it equal to zero. Then, solve for x. Let me try that.The dot product of two vectors is calculated by multiplying their corresponding components and then adding those products together. So, for vectors a = (a1, a2, a3) and b = (b1, b2, b3), the dot product is a1*b1 + a2*b2 + a3*b3. Right?So, applying that to the given vectors:a = (-2, 1, 3)b = (1, x, -1)Dot product = (-2)*1 + 1*x + 3*(-1)Let me compute each term step by step.First term: (-2)*1 = -2Second term: 1*x = xThird term: 3*(-1) = -3Now, adding them all together: -2 + x - 3Combine the constants: -2 - 3 = -5So, the dot product simplifies to x - 5.Since the vectors are perpendicular, their dot product is zero. Therefore, I can set up the equation:x - 5 = 0Solving for x, I just add 5 to both sides:x = 5Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.First term: (-2)*1 is indeed -2.Second term: 1*x is x.Third term: 3*(-1) is -3.Adding them: -2 + x - 3 is x - 5. Yep, that's correct.Setting x - 5 equal to zero gives x = 5. Okay, that seems right.Just to be thorough, maybe I can plug x = 5 back into vector b and compute the dot product again to confirm it's zero.So, vector b becomes (1, 5, -1). Then, the dot product with a is:(-2)*1 + 1*5 + 3*(-1) = (-2) + 5 + (-3) = (-2 + 5) + (-3) = 3 - 3 = 0.Perfect, that checks out. So, x is indeed 5.I don't think I made any mistakes here. It was a pretty straightforward problem once I remembered that perpendicular vectors have a dot product of zero. I just had to compute the dot product, set it to zero, and solve for x. Everything seems to add up correctly.Just to recap:1. Understand that perpendicular vectors have a dot product of zero.2. Compute the dot product of a and b.3. Set the dot product equal to zero.4. Solve the resulting equation for x.5. Verify the solution by plugging it back into the original vectors and computing the dot product again.All steps went smoothly, and the verification confirmed that x = 5 is the correct answer. I think I'm confident with this solution.**Final Answer**The value of ( x ) is boxed{5}."},{"question":"John is half times younger than his father, who is 4 years older than John's mother. If John's father is 40 years old, what's the age difference between John and his mother?","answer":"First, I know that John's father is 40 years old.Since John is half as young as his father, I can calculate John's age by dividing the father's age by 2. So, John is 20 years old.Next, the father is 4 years older than John's mother. To find the mother's age, I subtract 4 years from the father's age. Therefore, the mother is 36 years old.Finally, to determine the age difference between John and his mother, I subtract John's age from the mother's age. That gives a difference of 16 years."},{"question":"Given that n is a positive integer, and given that mathop{text{lcm}}[24,n]=72 and mathop{text{lcm}}[n,27]=108, what is n?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find a positive integer ( n ) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of 24 and ( n ) is 72, and the LCM of ( n ) and 27 is 108. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that the LCM of two numbers relates to their prime factorizations. Specifically, the LCM is the product of the highest powers of all primes that appear in either number. So maybe I should start by factoring 24, 72, 27, and 108 into their prime components. Let me write those down.24 can be factored into ( 2^3 times 3^1 ).  72 is ( 2^3 times 3^2 ).  27 is ( 3^3 ).  108 is ( 2^2 times 3^3 ).Alright, so now let me think about what this tells me about ( n ). Since ( mathop{text{lcm}}[24, n] = 72 ), the LCM of 24 and ( n ) must be 72. Similarly, ( mathop{text{lcm}}[n, 27] = 108 ). So, ( n ) must be a number that, when combined with 24, gives an LCM of 72, and when combined with 27, gives an LCM of 108.Let me break this down. Let's denote the prime factors of ( n ) as ( 2^a times 3^b times ) (other primes if any). But since 24 is ( 2^3 times 3^1 ) and 27 is ( 3^3 ), and the LCMs with ( n ) don't include any other primes, ( n ) must only have primes 2 and 3 in its factorization. So, ( n ) is of the form ( 2^a times 3^b ), where ( a ) and ( b ) are non-negative integers.Now, let's analyze the first condition: ( mathop{text{lcm}}[24, n] = 72 ).  24 is ( 2^3 times 3^1 ), and ( n ) is ( 2^a times 3^b ).  The LCM of these two would be ( 2^{max(3,a)} times 3^{max(1,b)} ).  We know this equals 72, which is ( 2^3 times 3^2 ).  So, setting the exponents equal, we have:  ( max(3, a) = 3 ) and ( max(1, b) = 2 ).From ( max(3, a) = 3 ), this implies that ( a leq 3 ).  From ( max(1, b) = 2 ), this implies that ( b = 2 ).  So, ( a ) can be 0, 1, 2, or 3, and ( b ) must be exactly 2.Now, let's look at the second condition: ( mathop{text{lcm}}[n, 27] = 108 ).  27 is ( 3^3 ), and ( n ) is ( 2^a times 3^b ).  The LCM of these two is ( 2^{max(a,0)} times 3^{max(b,3)} ).  We know this equals 108, which is ( 2^2 times 3^3 ).  Therefore, setting the exponents equal, we have:  ( max(a, 0) = 2 ) and ( max(b, 3) = 3 ).From ( max(a, 0) = 2 ), since ( a ) is a non-negative integer, this implies that ( a = 2 ).  From ( max(b, 3) = 3 ), this implies that ( b leq 3 ).Wait, but from the first condition, we already had ( b = 2 ). So, ( b = 2 ) satisfies ( b leq 3 ), which is fine.So, putting it all together, from the first condition, ( a leq 3 ) and ( b = 2 ). From the second condition, ( a = 2 ) and ( b leq 3 ). Therefore, ( a ) must be 2, and ( b ) must be 2.Therefore, ( n = 2^2 times 3^2 ). Let me compute that: ( 2^2 = 4 ), ( 3^2 = 9 ), so ( 4 times 9 = 36 ). So, ( n = 36 ).But wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's verify both conditions.First, ( mathop{text{lcm}}[24, 36] ).  24 is ( 2^3 times 3^1 ), 36 is ( 2^2 times 3^2 ).  The LCM would be ( 2^{max(3,2)} times 3^{max(1,2)} = 2^3 times 3^2 = 8 times 9 = 72 ). That's correct.Second, ( mathop{text{lcm}}[36, 27] ).  36 is ( 2^2 times 3^2 ), 27 is ( 3^3 ).  The LCM is ( 2^{max(2,0)} times 3^{max(2,3)} = 2^2 times 3^3 = 4 times 27 = 108 ). That also checks out.So, yeah, ( n = 36 ) satisfies both conditions. I think that's the answer.Just to make sure, let me think if there's any other possible value for ( n ). From the first condition, ( a ) could be 0, 1, 2, or 3, but the second condition forced ( a = 2 ). So, no, there's no other value for ( a ) or ( b ) that would satisfy both conditions. So, 36 is the only possible ( n ).**Final Answer**The value of ( n ) is boxed{36}."},{"question":"An 8-cm-by-8-cm square is partitioned as shown.

It's partitioned in some way, and there are points A and B which are midpoints of two opposite sides. The question is asking for the area of the shaded region shown in the Asymptote figure. Hmm, okay, let me try to visualize this.First, since it's an 8x8 square, each side is 8 cm. Points A and B are midpoints, so they must be at 4 cm from each corner on their respective sides. The Asymptote code draws the square and then some lines connecting these midpoints and other points. It also shades a region which seems to be a quadrilateral connecting (5,0), (7.5,5), (5,10), and (2.5,5). Wait, but in the problem, the square is 8 cm, but in the Asymptote code, it's drawn from (0,0) to (10,10). Hmm, maybe the Asymptote code is just scaled up for drawing purposes. So, I need to be careful with the coordinates.Let me try to sketch this mentally. The square has sides of 8 cm. Points A and B are midpoints, so A is at (4,8) if we consider the square from (0,0) to (8,8). Similarly, B is at (4,0). The Asymptote code seems to have a square from (0,0) to (10,10), so maybe it's scaled by a factor of 10/8 or something. But maybe I can just work with the given coordinates in the Asymptote code for simplicity, and then adjust the area accordingly.Looking at the Asymptote code, the shaded region is a quadrilateral with vertices at (5,0), (7.5,5), (5,10), and (2.5,5). So, in the Asymptote coordinate system, this is a diamond-shaped figure in the center of the square. Since the square in the Asymptote code is 10 units on each side, but the actual square is 8 cm, I need to figure out the scaling factor.Wait, maybe I don't need to worry about scaling because the Asymptote code is just for illustration. The problem states it's an 8x8 square, so all measurements should be in cm. So, perhaps I can ignore the Asymptote coordinates and just think in terms of the 8x8 square.Let me try to reconstruct the figure. The square is divided by lines connecting midpoints and other points. Points A and B are midpoints of two opposite sides. So, if the square is from (0,0) to (8,8), then A is at (4,8) and B is at (4,0). The Asymptote code draws lines from (0,0) to (5,10), but in our case, it should be from (0,0) to (4,8), right? Wait, no, because 5 is half of 10, but in our case, it's 4 is half of 8.Wait, maybe the Asymptote code is using a different coordinate system where the square is 10 units, but the actual problem is 8 cm. So, perhaps each unit in the Asymptote code corresponds to 0.8 cm in the problem. Hmm, that might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe I can just solve it using the Asymptote coordinates and then scale the area down accordingly.Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the Asymptote coordinates as a 10x10 grid, but the actual square is 8x8, so each unit in the Asymptote code is 0.8 cm. Therefore, the coordinates (5,0) would correspond to (4,0) in the actual square, since 5*0.8=4. Similarly, (7.5,5) would be (6,4) in the actual square, because 7.5*0.8=6 and 5*0.8=4. Wait, is that right? Let me check:If the Asymptote square is 10 units, and the actual square is 8 cm, then each unit is 0.8 cm. So, to convert Asymptote coordinates to actual cm, we multiply by 0.8. So, (5,0) becomes (4,0), (7.5,5) becomes (6,4), (5,10) becomes (4,8), and (2.5,5) becomes (2,4). So, the shaded region in the actual square is a quadrilateral with vertices at (4,0), (6,4), (4,8), and (2,4). Hmm, okay, that makes sense.So, in the actual square, the shaded region is a quadrilateral connecting (4,0), (6,4), (4,8), and (2,4). Wait, that seems like a kite-shaped figure. Alternatively, it might be a rectangle or something else. Let me plot these points mentally:- (4,0): midpoint of the bottom side.- (6,4): somewhere on the right half of the square, 2 units to the right of the center and 4 units up.- (4,8): midpoint of the top side.- (2,4): somewhere on the left half of the square, 2 units to the left of the center and 4 units up.Connecting these points, it should form a diamond shape, symmetric across the vertical and horizontal center lines of the square. So, the shaded region is a convex quadrilateral with vertices at those four points.To find the area of this quadrilateral, I can use the shoelace formula. That's a reliable method for finding the area of a polygon when you know the coordinates of its vertices. Let me recall how the shoelace formula works.Given a polygon with vertices (x1, y1), (x2, y2), ..., (xn, yn), the area is given by:Area = |(x1y2 + x2y3 + ... + xn y1) - (y1x2 + y2x3 + ... + ynx1)| / 2So, applying this to our quadrilateral with vertices (4,0), (6,4), (4,8), (2,4). Let me list them in order, either clockwise or counterclockwise. Let's go clockwise:1. (4,0)2. (6,4)3. (4,8)4. (2,4)5. Back to (4,0)So, applying the shoelace formula:First, compute the sum of x1y2 + x2y3 + x3y4 + x4y1:(4*4) + (6*8) + (4*4) + (2*0) = 16 + 48 + 16 + 0 = 80Then, compute the sum of y1x2 + y2x3 + y3x4 + y4x1:(0*6) + (4*4) + (8*2) + (4*4) = 0 + 16 + 16 + 16 = 48Subtract the two sums: 80 - 48 = 32Take the absolute value (which is still 32) and divide by 2: 32 / 2 = 16So, the area is 16 cm¬≤.Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I might mix up the coordinates.Let me write down each step:First sum (x1y2 + x2y3 + x3y4 + x4y1):x1 = 4, y2 = 4: 4*4 = 16x2 = 6, y3 = 8: 6*8 = 48x3 = 4, y4 = 4: 4*4 = 16x4 = 2, y1 = 0: 2*0 = 0Total: 16 + 48 + 16 + 0 = 80Second sum (y1x2 + y2x3 + y3x4 + y4x1):y1 = 0, x2 = 6: 0*6 = 0y2 = 4, x3 = 4: 4*4 = 16y3 = 8, x4 = 2: 8*2 = 16y4 = 4, x1 = 4: 4*4 = 16Total: 0 + 16 + 16 + 16 = 48Difference: 80 - 48 = 32Area: |32| / 2 = 16Yes, that seems correct. So, the area of the shaded region is 16 cm¬≤.Alternatively, I can think of this quadrilateral as two congruent triangles. Looking at the points, from (4,0) to (6,4) to (4,8) to (2,4) and back. If I split this quadrilateral along the vertical line x=4, which is the center of the square, I can see two triangles on either side.Wait, actually, splitting it along the vertical line might not give congruent triangles, but maybe splitting it along the horizontal line y=4. Let me see.Alternatively, perhaps it's a trapezoid? Wait, no, because both pairs of opposite sides are not parallel. Wait, actually, let me check the slopes of the sides.From (4,0) to (6,4): slope is (4-0)/(6-4) = 4/2 = 2From (6,4) to (4,8): slope is (8-4)/(4-6) = 4/(-2) = -2From (4,8) to (2,4): slope is (4-8)/(2-4) = (-4)/(-2) = 2From (2,4) to (4,0): slope is (0-4)/(4-2) = (-4)/2 = -2So, the sides alternate between slopes of 2 and -2. Therefore, the opposite sides are parallel because they have the same slope. So, this is actually a parallelogram.Wait, but earlier I thought it was a kite. Hmm, but if opposite sides are parallel, it's a parallelogram. But in this case, since the sides are equal in length as well, it's actually a rhombus.Wait, let me check the lengths of the sides.From (4,0) to (6,4): distance is sqrt[(6-4)^2 + (4-0)^2] = sqrt[4 + 16] = sqrt[20] = 2*sqrt(5)From (6,4) to (4,8): distance is sqrt[(4-6)^2 + (8-4)^2] = sqrt[4 + 16] = sqrt[20] = 2*sqrt(5)From (4,8) to (2,4): distance is sqrt[(2-4)^2 + (4-8)^2] = sqrt[4 + 16] = sqrt[20] = 2*sqrt(5)From (2,4) to (4,0): distance is sqrt[(4-2)^2 + (0-4)^2] = sqrt[4 + 16] = sqrt[20] = 2*sqrt(5)So, all sides are equal, which confirms it's a rhombus. Therefore, the area can also be calculated as (d1*d2)/2, where d1 and d2 are the lengths of the diagonals.What are the diagonals? The diagonals connect opposite vertices. So, one diagonal is from (4,0) to (4,8), which is vertical, and the other diagonal is from (6,4) to (2,4), which is horizontal.Wait, let me confirm:Wait, in a rhombus, the diagonals are the lines connecting opposite vertices. So, in our case, the vertices are (4,0), (6,4), (4,8), (2,4). So, the diagonals would be from (4,0) to (4,8) and from (6,4) to (2,4).So, the first diagonal is from (4,0) to (4,8). The length of this diagonal is 8 units (from y=0 to y=8).The second diagonal is from (6,4) to (2,4). The length of this diagonal is 4 units (from x=2 to x=6).Therefore, the area is (d1*d2)/2 = (8*4)/2 = 32/2 = 16 cm¬≤.So, that's another way to get the same answer, 16 cm¬≤.Alternatively, I could also compute the area by finding the area of triangles or other shapes within the figure.But since both methods gave me 16 cm¬≤, I feel confident that the area is indeed 16.Wait, but just to make sure, let me try another approach. Maybe coordinate geometry.Since the figure is a rhombus, another way to find the area is to compute the base times height.But in this case, since it's a rhombus, all sides are equal, but the height can be calculated based on the angle.Alternatively, since we have the coordinates, we can compute the vectors and use the cross product.Let me try that.Take two adjacent sides as vectors. For example, from (4,0) to (6,4) is vector (2,4), and from (4,0) to (2,4) is vector (-2,4).The area of the parallelogram (which is the rhombus) is the magnitude of the cross product of these two vectors.The cross product in 2D is given by |v1 x v2| = |v1_x * v2_y - v1_y * v2_x|So, vector v1 is (2,4), vector v2 is (-2,4).Cross product: (2)(4) - (4)(-2) = 8 + 8 = 16Therefore, the area is |16| = 16 cm¬≤.Yes, that's another confirmation.Alternatively, if I consider the figure as a transformation of the square, but that might complicate things.Alternatively, since the figure is a rhombus, and we know the lengths of the diagonals, which are 8 and 4, as calculated earlier, the area is (8*4)/2 = 16.So, all methods lead to the same result, so I think 16 cm¬≤ is correct.Therefore, the area of the shaded region is 16 cm¬≤.**Final Answer**The area of the shaded region is boxed{16} square centimeters."},{"question":"Simplify first, then find the value of 2(x^{2}y-2xy)-3(x^{2}y-3xy)+x^{2}y, where x=-frac{2}{5} and y=2.","answer":"First, I need to simplify the given expression ( 2(x^{2}y - 2xy) - 3(x^{2}y - 3xy) + x^{2}y ).I'll start by distributing the coefficients inside each parenthesis:- For the first term, ( 2(x^{2}y - 2xy) ) becomes ( 2x^{2}y - 4xy ).- For the second term, ( -3(x^{2}y - 3xy) ) becomes ( -3x^{2}y + 9xy ).Now, I'll combine all the terms:( 2x^{2}y - 4xy - 3x^{2}y + 9xy + x^{2}y ).Next, I'll combine like terms:- The ( x^{2}y ) terms: ( 2x^{2}y - 3x^{2}y + x^{2}y = 0 ).- The ( xy ) terms: ( -4xy + 9xy = 5xy ).So, the simplified expression is ( 5xy ).Now, I'll substitute ( x = -frac{2}{5} ) and ( y = 2 ) into the simplified expression:( 5 times left(-frac{2}{5}right) times 2 ).Calculating this:( 5 times left(-frac{2}{5}right) times 2 = -4 ).Therefore, the value of the expression is (-4)."},{"question":"If a > 1, then the sum of the real solutions of sqrt{a - sqrt{a + x}} = xis equal to textbf{(A)} sqrt{a} - 1qquad textbf{(B)} dfrac{sqrt{a}- 1}{2}qquad textbf{(C)} sqrt{a - 1}qquad textbf{(D)} dfrac{sqrt{a - 1}}{2}qquad textbf{(E)} dfrac{sqrt{4a- 3} - 1}{2}","answer":"Okay, so I have this equation to solve: ‚àö(a - ‚àö(a + x)) = x, and I need to find the sum of the real solutions when a > 1. The answer choices are given, so maybe I can work through it step by step.First, let me write down the equation again:‚àö(a - ‚àö(a + x)) = xHmm, since there's a square root on the left side, I should probably square both sides to eliminate it. That usually helps with these kinds of equations. So, squaring both sides:(‚àö(a - ‚àö(a + x}))¬≤ = x¬≤Which simplifies to:a - ‚àö(a + x) = x¬≤Alright, now I have:a - ‚àö(a + x) = x¬≤I still have a square root here, so maybe I can isolate that and square again. Let me rearrange the equation:‚àö(a + x) = a - x¬≤Now, square both sides again to get rid of the square root:(‚àö(a + x))¬≤ = (a - x¬≤)¬≤Simplifying:a + x = (a - x¬≤)¬≤Let me expand the right side. (a - x¬≤)¬≤ is a¬≤ - 2a x¬≤ + x‚Å¥. So:a + x = a¬≤ - 2a x¬≤ + x‚Å¥Now, let's bring all terms to one side to set the equation to zero:x‚Å¥ - 2a x¬≤ + a¬≤ - a - x = 0Hmm, that's a quartic equation. Quartic equations can be tricky, but maybe I can factor this or find a substitution that simplifies it. Let me see.Looking at the equation:x‚Å¥ - 2a x¬≤ - x + (a¬≤ - a) = 0I notice that the equation has terms with x‚Å¥, x¬≤, x, and constants. Maybe I can make a substitution to turn this into a quadratic equation. Let me try letting y = x¬≤. Then, x‚Å¥ becomes y¬≤, but I still have the linear term -x, which complicates things because y = x¬≤ doesn't help with the x term. Hmm, maybe that substitution isn't the best.Alternatively, perhaps I can rearrange the equation to group terms:x‚Å¥ - 2a x¬≤ - x + a¬≤ - a = 0Let me see if I can factor this. Maybe grouping terms:(x‚Å¥ - 2a x¬≤ + a¬≤) - x - a = 0Notice that x‚Å¥ - 2a x¬≤ + a¬≤ is a perfect square: (x¬≤ - a)¬≤. So:(x¬≤ - a)¬≤ - x - a = 0So, now the equation is:(x¬≤ - a)¬≤ - (x + a) = 0Hmm, not sure if that helps directly, but maybe I can write it as:(x¬≤ - a)¬≤ = x + aTaking square roots on both sides? Wait, but that might complicate things because of the square on the left. Alternatively, maybe I can set t = x¬≤ - a, so the equation becomes:t¬≤ = x + aBut then I have t = x¬≤ - a, so substituting:t¬≤ = x + aBut t = x¬≤ - a, so:(x¬≤ - a)¬≤ = x + aWhich is the same as before. Hmm, not sure if that substitution helps.Maybe another approach. Let's think about the original equation again:‚àö(a - ‚àö(a + x}) = xSince the square root on the left is equal to x, x must be non-negative because square roots are always non-negative. So, x ‚â• 0.Also, the expression inside the square root must be non-negative:a - ‚àö(a + x) ‚â• 0Which implies:‚àö(a + x) ‚â§ aSquaring both sides:a + x ‚â§ a¬≤So, x ‚â§ a¬≤ - aTherefore, x must satisfy 0 ‚â§ x ‚â§ a¬≤ - aAdditionally, inside the inner square root, ‚àö(a + x), the expression a + x must be non-negative:a + x ‚â• 0But since a > 1 and x is real, and from earlier x ‚â• 0, so a + x is always positive. So, no additional constraints there.So, x is in [0, a¬≤ - a]Now, going back to the equation after squaring twice:x‚Å¥ - 2a x¬≤ - x + a¬≤ - a = 0This quartic equation is difficult to solve directly. Maybe I can factor it or find rational roots.Let me try the Rational Root Theorem. The possible rational roots are factors of the constant term over factors of the leading coefficient. The constant term is a¬≤ - a, and the leading coefficient is 1. So possible rational roots are ¬±1, ¬±(a¬≤ - a), but since a is a variable, not a specific number, this might not be helpful.Alternatively, maybe I can factor this quartic equation as a quadratic in terms of x¬≤. Let me see:x‚Å¥ - 2a x¬≤ - x + a¬≤ - a = 0Hmm, but the presence of the linear term -x complicates things. Maybe I can rearrange terms:x‚Å¥ - 2a x¬≤ + a¬≤ - x - a = 0Which is (x¬≤ - a)¬≤ - x - a = 0Wait, that's the same as before. Maybe I can write it as:(x¬≤ - a)¬≤ = x + aSo, (x¬≤ - a)¬≤ = x + aLet me denote t = x¬≤ - a, so t¬≤ = x + aBut t = x¬≤ - a, so substituting:t¬≤ = x + aBut t = x¬≤ - a, so:t¬≤ = x + aSo, t¬≤ - x - a = 0But t = x¬≤ - a, so substituting back:(x¬≤ - a)¬≤ - x - a = 0Which is the same equation. Hmm, circular reasoning.Alternatively, maybe I can write this as:t¬≤ - x - a = 0But t = x¬≤ - a, so:(x¬≤ - a)¬≤ - x - a = 0Not helpful.Wait, maybe I can consider this as a system of equations:t = x¬≤ - at¬≤ = x + aSo, substituting t from the first equation into the second:(x¬≤ - a)¬≤ = x + aWhich is the same as before.Alternatively, maybe I can write t¬≤ = x + a and t = x¬≤ - a, so substituting t into the second equation:(x¬≤ - a)¬≤ = x + aBut that's the same quartic equation.Alternatively, maybe I can subtract the two equations:t¬≤ - t = x + a - (x¬≤ - a) = x + a - x¬≤ + a = -x¬≤ + x + 2aSo, t¬≤ - t = -x¬≤ + x + 2aBut t = x¬≤ - a, so:(x¬≤ - a)¬≤ - (x¬≤ - a) = -x¬≤ + x + 2aWait, let's compute the left side:(x¬≤ - a)¬≤ - (x¬≤ - a) = (x‚Å¥ - 2a x¬≤ + a¬≤) - x¬≤ + a = x‚Å¥ - 2a x¬≤ + a¬≤ - x¬≤ + a = x‚Å¥ - (2a + 1)x¬≤ + a¬≤ + aSet equal to the right side:x‚Å¥ - (2a + 1)x¬≤ + a¬≤ + a = -x¬≤ + x + 2aBring all terms to the left:x‚Å¥ - (2a + 1)x¬≤ + a¬≤ + a + x¬≤ - x - 2a = 0Simplify:x‚Å¥ - (2a + 1 - 1)x¬≤ + (a¬≤ + a - 2a) - x = 0Which is:x‚Å¥ - 2a x¬≤ + a¬≤ - a - x = 0Which is the same quartic equation as before. So, this approach isn't helping.Maybe I need to consider that the quartic equation can be factored into quadratics.Let me attempt to factor x‚Å¥ - 2a x¬≤ - x + a¬≤ - a.Suppose it factors as (x¬≤ + p x + q)(x¬≤ + r x + s) = 0Multiplying out:x‚Å¥ + (p + r)x¬≥ + (q + s + pr)x¬≤ + (ps + qr)x + q s = 0Comparing coefficients with x‚Å¥ - 2a x¬≤ - x + a¬≤ - a:So, coefficients must satisfy:1. Coefficient of x‚Å¥: 1 = 1 (okay)2. Coefficient of x¬≥: p + r = 03. Coefficient of x¬≤: q + s + p r = -2a4. Coefficient of x: p s + q r = -15. Constant term: q s = a¬≤ - aFrom equation 2: p + r = 0 => r = -pFrom equation 5: q s = a¬≤ - aFrom equation 4: p s + q r = -1. Since r = -p, this becomes p s - p q = -1 => p(s - q) = -1From equation 3: q + s + p r = q + s + p*(-p) = q + s - p¬≤ = -2aSo, we have:1. r = -p2. q s = a¬≤ - a3. p(s - q) = -14. q + s - p¬≤ = -2aThis is a system of equations in variables p, q, s.Let me see if I can find integers p, q, s that satisfy these. Maybe p is a small integer.From equation 3: p(s - q) = -1Since p and (s - q) are integers (assuming q and s are integers), the possible pairs (p, s - q) are (1, -1) or (-1, 1)Case 1: p = 1, s - q = -1Then, from equation 3: 1*(s - q) = -1 => s = q -1From equation 5: q s = a¬≤ - a => q (q -1) = a¬≤ - a => q¬≤ - q - (a¬≤ - a) = 0This is a quadratic in q: q¬≤ - q - (a¬≤ - a) = 0Solutions:q = [1 ¬± ‚àö(1 + 4(a¬≤ - a))]/2 = [1 ¬± ‚àö(4a¬≤ - 4a + 1)]/2 = [1 ¬± (2a -1)]/2So, q = [1 + (2a -1)]/2 = (2a)/2 = aOr q = [1 - (2a -1)]/2 = (2 - 2a)/2 = 1 - aSo, q = a or q = 1 - aThen, s = q -1, so:If q = a, then s = a -1If q = 1 - a, then s = (1 - a) -1 = -aSo, let's check both possibilities.First, q = a, s = a -1From equation 4: q + s - p¬≤ = a + (a -1) - 1¬≤ = 2a -1 -1 = 2a -2This must equal -2a, so:2a -2 = -2a => 4a = 2 => a = 0.5But a > 1, so this is not possible.Second, q = 1 - a, s = -aFrom equation 4: q + s - p¬≤ = (1 - a) + (-a) - 1 = 1 - 2a -1 = -2aWhich equals -2a, so that works.So, in this case, p =1, q =1 - a, s = -a, r = -1Therefore, the quartic factors as:(x¬≤ + p x + q)(x¬≤ + r x + s) = (x¬≤ + x + (1 - a))(x¬≤ - x - a)So, x‚Å¥ - 2a x¬≤ - x + a¬≤ - a = (x¬≤ + x +1 - a)(x¬≤ - x - a)Therefore, the quartic equation factors into:(x¬≤ + x +1 - a)(x¬≤ - x - a) = 0So, either:x¬≤ + x +1 - a = 0orx¬≤ - x - a = 0So, let's solve each quadratic equation.First equation: x¬≤ + x +1 - a = 0Solutions:x = [-1 ¬± ‚àö(1 - 4*(1 - a))]/2 = [-1 ¬± ‚àö(1 -4 +4a)]/2 = [-1 ¬± ‚àö(4a -3)]/2Second equation: x¬≤ - x - a = 0Solutions:x = [1 ¬± ‚àö(1 + 4a)]/2So, altogether, the quartic equation has four roots:1. x = [-1 + ‚àö(4a -3)]/22. x = [-1 - ‚àö(4a -3)]/23. x = [1 + ‚àö(1 + 4a)]/24. x = [1 - ‚àö(1 + 4a)]/2But remember, from earlier, x must satisfy 0 ‚â§ x ‚â§ a¬≤ - aAlso, in the original equation, ‚àö(a - ‚àö(a + x}) = x, x must be non-negative, so we can discard any negative roots.Let's analyze each solution:1. x = [-1 + ‚àö(4a -3)]/2Since a >1, 4a -3 >1, so ‚àö(4a -3) >1, so numerator is (-1 + something >1), so positive.So, this is a positive root.2. x = [-1 - ‚àö(4a -3)]/2This is negative because both terms in the numerator are negative, so we can discard this.3. x = [1 + ‚àö(1 + 4a)]/2This is positive because both terms are positive.4. x = [1 - ‚àö(1 + 4a)]/2Since ‚àö(1 +4a) >1, so 1 - ‚àö(1 +4a) is negative, so this is negative. Discard.Therefore, the real solutions are:x‚ÇÅ = [-1 + ‚àö(4a -3)]/2x‚ÇÇ = [1 + ‚àö(1 +4a)]/2But wait, we need to check if these solutions satisfy the original equation because sometimes squaring can introduce extraneous solutions.So, let's check each solution.First, x‚ÇÅ = [-1 + ‚àö(4a -3)]/2Let me compute ‚àö(a - ‚àö(a + x‚ÇÅ}) and see if it equals x‚ÇÅ.But this might be complicated. Alternatively, let's recall that when we squared twice, we might have introduced extraneous solutions, so it's important to check.Alternatively, perhaps we can analyze the behavior of the functions.Let me define f(x) = ‚àö(a - ‚àö(a + x})We have f(x) = xSo, the solutions are the intersections of f(x) and y = x.Given that f(x) is a decreasing function because as x increases, ‚àö(a + x) increases, so a - ‚àö(a + x) decreases, so f(x) decreases.y = x is an increasing function.Therefore, they can intersect at most once.Wait, but we have two positive solutions? That seems contradictory.Wait, but actually, f(x) is defined only for x such that a + x ‚â•0 and a - ‚àö(a +x) ‚â•0.So, x ‚â• -a, but since x must be non-negative, x ‚àà [0, a¬≤ -a]So, f(x) is decreasing on [0, a¬≤ -a]And y = x is increasing on [0, a¬≤ -a]Therefore, they can intersect at most once.But earlier, we found two positive solutions. So, one of them must be extraneous.Therefore, only one of x‚ÇÅ and x‚ÇÇ is a valid solution.So, which one is it?Let me test x‚ÇÅ and x‚ÇÇ in the original equation.First, let's compute x‚ÇÅ = [-1 + ‚àö(4a -3)]/2Let me compute f(x‚ÇÅ):f(x‚ÇÅ) = ‚àö(a - ‚àö(a + x‚ÇÅ})Let me compute a + x‚ÇÅ:a + x‚ÇÅ = a + [-1 + ‚àö(4a -3)]/2 = (2a -1 + ‚àö(4a -3))/2Then, ‚àö(a + x‚ÇÅ) = ‚àö[(2a -1 + ‚àö(4a -3))/2]Then, a - ‚àö(a + x‚ÇÅ) = a - ‚àö[(2a -1 + ‚àö(4a -3))/2]This seems complicated, but let's see if it's equal to x‚ÇÅ¬≤.Wait, from the equation after first squaring:a - ‚àö(a + x) = x¬≤So, if x = x‚ÇÅ, then a - ‚àö(a + x‚ÇÅ) should equal x‚ÇÅ¬≤.So, let's compute a - ‚àö(a + x‚ÇÅ):a - ‚àö(a + x‚ÇÅ) = x‚ÇÅ¬≤So, let's compute both sides.Left side: a - ‚àö(a + x‚ÇÅ)Right side: x‚ÇÅ¬≤ = [(-1 + ‚àö(4a -3))/2]^2 = [1 - 2‚àö(4a -3) + (4a -3)]/4 = [4a -2 - 2‚àö(4a -3)]/4 = [2a -1 - ‚àö(4a -3)]/2So, left side: a - ‚àö(a + x‚ÇÅ) = a - ‚àö[(2a -1 + ‚àö(4a -3))/2]Let me compute ‚àö[(2a -1 + ‚àö(4a -3))/2]Let me denote t = ‚àö(4a -3), so t¬≤ = 4a -3 => a = (t¬≤ +3)/4Then, 2a -1 = 2*(t¬≤ +3)/4 -1 = (t¬≤ +3)/2 -1 = (t¬≤ +1)/2So, 2a -1 + t = (t¬≤ +1)/2 + t = (t¬≤ + 2t +1)/2 = (t +1)^2 /2Therefore, ‚àö[(2a -1 + t)/2] = ‚àö[(t +1)^2 / (2*2)] = ‚àö[(t +1)^2 /4] = (t +1)/2So, ‚àö[(2a -1 + ‚àö(4a -3))/2] = (t +1)/2 = [‚àö(4a -3) +1]/2Therefore, left side: a - [‚àö(4a -3) +1]/2Compute this:a - [‚àö(4a -3) +1]/2 = (2a - ‚àö(4a -3) -1)/2Compare with right side: [2a -1 - ‚àö(4a -3)]/2Yes, they are equal. So, x‚ÇÅ satisfies the equation after squaring. But does it satisfy the original equation?Because when we square, sometimes solutions can be introduced that don't satisfy the original equation.So, let's check if ‚àö(a - ‚àö(a + x‚ÇÅ}) = x‚ÇÅWe know that a - ‚àö(a + x‚ÇÅ) = x‚ÇÅ¬≤, so ‚àö(a - ‚àö(a + x‚ÇÅ}) = ‚àö(x‚ÇÅ¬≤) = |x‚ÇÅ|But x‚ÇÅ is positive, so ‚àö(x‚ÇÅ¬≤) = x‚ÇÅTherefore, x‚ÇÅ is a valid solution.Now, let's check x‚ÇÇ = [1 + ‚àö(1 +4a)]/2Compute f(x‚ÇÇ) = ‚àö(a - ‚àö(a + x‚ÇÇ})Compute a + x‚ÇÇ:a + x‚ÇÇ = a + [1 + ‚àö(1 +4a)]/2 = (2a +1 + ‚àö(1 +4a))/2Compute ‚àö(a + x‚ÇÇ):‚àö[(2a +1 + ‚àö(1 +4a))/2]Let me denote s = ‚àö(1 +4a), so s¬≤ =1 +4a => a = (s¬≤ -1)/4Then, 2a +1 = 2*(s¬≤ -1)/4 +1 = (s¬≤ -1)/2 +1 = (s¬≤ +1)/2So, 2a +1 + s = (s¬≤ +1)/2 + s = (s¬≤ + 2s +1)/2 = (s +1)^2 /2Therefore, ‚àö[(2a +1 + s)/2] = ‚àö[(s +1)^2 /4] = (s +1)/2So, ‚àö(a + x‚ÇÇ) = (s +1)/2 = [‚àö(1 +4a) +1]/2Then, a - ‚àö(a + x‚ÇÇ) = a - [‚àö(1 +4a) +1]/2Compute this:a - [‚àö(1 +4a) +1]/2 = (2a - ‚àö(1 +4a) -1)/2From the equation after first squaring, a - ‚àö(a +x) = x¬≤So, x‚ÇÇ¬≤ should equal (2a - ‚àö(1 +4a) -1)/2Compute x‚ÇÇ¬≤:x‚ÇÇ = [1 + ‚àö(1 +4a)]/2x‚ÇÇ¬≤ = [1 + 2‚àö(1 +4a) + (1 +4a)]/4 = [2 + 4a + 2‚àö(1 +4a)]/4 = [1 + 2a + ‚àö(1 +4a)]/2Compare with (2a - ‚àö(1 +4a) -1)/2These are not equal because x‚ÇÇ¬≤ = [1 + 2a + ‚àö(1 +4a)]/2 vs (2a - ‚àö(1 +4a) -1)/2They are negatives of each other in the ‚àö(1 +4a) term.Thus, x‚ÇÇ¬≤ ‚â† a - ‚àö(a +x‚ÇÇ). Therefore, x‚ÇÇ does not satisfy the equation after squaring, so it's an extraneous solution.Therefore, only x‚ÇÅ is a valid solution.Wait, but earlier I thought that f(x) and y =x can intersect at most once, but according to the quartic equation, there are two positive roots, but only one is valid.But the problem says \\"the sum of the real solutions\\", so if only x‚ÇÅ is a real solution, then the sum is x‚ÇÅ.But let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in assuming only one solution.Wait, let me graph the functions f(x) = ‚àö(a - ‚àö(a +x}) and y =x.f(x) is defined for x in [0, a¬≤ -a]At x=0: f(0) = ‚àö(a - ‚àöa}At x = a¬≤ -a: f(a¬≤ -a) = ‚àö(a - ‚àö(a +a¬≤ -a}) = ‚àö(a - ‚àö(a¬≤}) = ‚àö(a -a) = 0So, f(x) starts at ‚àö(a - ‚àöa) when x=0 and decreases to 0 at x = a¬≤ -ay =x starts at 0 and increases to a¬≤ -aTherefore, depending on the value of ‚àö(a - ‚àöa), which is f(0), if f(0) >0, which it is because a >1, so ‚àöa >1, so a - ‚àöa >0, so f(0) = ‚àö(a - ‚àöa) >0So, f(x) starts above y =x at x=0, and ends at 0 when x = a¬≤ -a, while y=x goes to a¬≤ -a.Therefore, they must intersect exactly once somewhere between 0 and a¬≤ -a.Therefore, only one real solution exists, which is x‚ÇÅ.But the quartic equation had two positive roots, but only x‚ÇÅ is valid, x‚ÇÇ is extraneous.Therefore, the sum of real solutions is just x‚ÇÅ.But wait, the answer choices are:(A) ‚àöa -1(B) (‚àöa -1)/2(C) ‚àö(a -1)(D) ‚àö(a -1)/2(E) [‚àö(4a -3) -1]/2Wait, x‚ÇÅ is [ -1 + ‚àö(4a -3) ] /2, which is [‚àö(4a -3) -1]/2, which is option E.Therefore, the sum of real solutions is [‚àö(4a -3) -1]/2, which is option E.Wait, but the question says \\"the sum of the real solutions\\". If there's only one real solution, then the sum is that solution itself. So, the answer is E.But let me double-check in case I missed something.Wait, is there a possibility that x‚ÇÇ is also a solution?Earlier, when I checked x‚ÇÇ, it didn't satisfy the equation after squaring, so it's extraneous.But just to be thorough, let's plug x‚ÇÇ into the original equation.x‚ÇÇ = [1 + ‚àö(1 +4a)]/2Compute ‚àö(a - ‚àö(a +x‚ÇÇ})Compute a +x‚ÇÇ = a + [1 + ‚àö(1 +4a)]/2 = (2a +1 + ‚àö(1 +4a))/2Compute ‚àö(a +x‚ÇÇ) = ‚àö[(2a +1 + ‚àö(1 +4a))/2]As before, let s = ‚àö(1 +4a), so a = (s¬≤ -1)/4Then, 2a +1 = (s¬≤ -1)/2 +1 = (s¬≤ +1)/2So, 2a +1 + s = (s¬≤ +1)/2 + s = (s¬≤ + 2s +1)/2 = (s +1)^2 /2Therefore, ‚àö(a +x‚ÇÇ) = ‚àö[(s +1)^2 /4] = (s +1)/2So, a - ‚àö(a +x‚ÇÇ) = a - (s +1)/2 = (2a -s -1)/2But s = ‚àö(1 +4a), so:a - ‚àö(a +x‚ÇÇ) = (2a - ‚àö(1 +4a) -1)/2Now, compute ‚àö(a - ‚àö(a +x‚ÇÇ}) = ‚àö[(2a - ‚àö(1 +4a) -1)/2]Compare this to x‚ÇÇ = [1 + ‚àö(1 +4a)]/2Are these equal?Let me square both sides:Left side: [‚àö(a - ‚àö(a +x‚ÇÇ})]^2 = (2a - ‚àö(1 +4a) -1)/2Right side: x‚ÇÇ¬≤ = [1 + 2‚àö(1 +4a) + (1 +4a)]/4 = [2 + 4a + 2‚àö(1 +4a)]/4 = [1 + 2a + ‚àö(1 +4a)]/2So, left side: (2a - ‚àö(1 +4a) -1)/2Right side: (1 + 2a + ‚àö(1 +4a))/2These are not equal because the left side has a negative ‚àö(1 +4a) term, while the right side has a positive one. Therefore, ‚àö(a - ‚àö(a +x‚ÇÇ}) ‚â† x‚ÇÇTherefore, x‚ÇÇ is indeed extraneous.Thus, only x‚ÇÅ is a valid solution, so the sum is x‚ÇÅ, which is [‚àö(4a -3) -1]/2, option E.**Final Answer**boxed{E}"},{"question":"The excellent traditional Chinese culture is the \\"root\\" and \\"soul\\" of the Chinese nation, which is the cultural root and gene that must be passed down from generation to generation.

It is known that the school spent 3600 on \\"Romance of the Three Kingdoms\\" comic books and 4800 on \\"Water Margin\\" comic books. The number of sets of \\"Romance of the Three Kingdoms\\" comic books purchased is half the number of sets of \\"Water Margin\\" comic books purchased. Find the price of each set of \\"Water Margin\\" comic books.(1) Let the price of each set of \\"Water Margin\\" comic books be x dollars. Express the following using expressions containing x:The price of each set of \\"Romance of the Three Kingdoms\\" comic books is ______ dollars, the number of sets of \\"Romance of the Three Kingdoms\\" comic books purchased is ______, and the number of sets of \\"Water Margin\\" comic books purchased is ______.(2) Write down the equations and complete the solution to this problem.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a school buying sets of comic books for each class. They bought \\"Romance of the Three Kingdoms\\" and \\"Water Margin.\\" The problem gives me some information about the prices and the amounts spent, and I need to find the price of each set of \\"Water Margin\\" comic books. Let me try to break this down step by step.First, let me read the problem again carefully to make sure I understand all the details.The problem says that the price of each set of \\"Romance of the Three Kingdoms\\" is 60 more expensive than each set of \\"Water Margin.\\" So if I let the price of \\"Water Margin\\" be x dollars, then \\"Romance of the Three Kingdoms\\" would be x + 60 dollars. That seems straightforward.Next, it mentions that the school spent 3600 on \\"Romance of the Three Kingdoms\\" and 4800 on \\"Water Margin.\\" So, they spent more on \\"Water Margin\\" than on \\"Romance of the Three Kingdoms.\\" But the number of sets bought for \\"Romance of the Three Kingdoms\\" is half the number of sets bought for \\"Water Margin.\\" Hmm, that's interesting. So even though they spent less on \\"Romance of the Three Kingdoms,\\" they bought fewer sets because each set is more expensive.Alright, so let me structure this. Let me denote:- Let x be the price of each set of \\"Water Margin\\" comic books. So, each set of \\"Romance of the Three Kingdoms\\" is x + 60 dollars.Now, the number of sets purchased for each can be calculated by dividing the total amount spent by the price per set. So, the number of sets of \\"Romance of the Three Kingdoms\\" is 3600 divided by (x + 60), and the number of sets of \\"Water Margin\\" is 4800 divided by x.But wait, the problem also says that the number of sets of \\"Romance of the Three Kingdoms\\" is half the number of sets of \\"Water Margin.\\" So, if I let the number of sets of \\"Water Margin\\" be N, then the number of sets of \\"Romance of the Three Kingdoms\\" is N/2.Alternatively, using the expressions I have, the number of sets of \\"Romance of the Three Kingdoms\\" is 3600 / (x + 60), and the number of sets of \\"Water Margin\\" is 4800 / x. According to the problem, 3600 / (x + 60) = (1/2) * (4800 / x). That seems like the equation I need to set up.Let me write that down:3600 / (x + 60) = (1/2) * (4800 / x)Okay, so that's the equation. Now, I need to solve for x.Before I proceed, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in setting up the equation. So, the number of sets of \\"Romance\\" is half the number of sets of \\"Water Margin.\\" So, if I denote the number of sets of \\"Water Margin\\" as N, then \\"Romance\\" is N/2. Alternatively, using the total spent divided by price per set, \\"Romance\\" is 3600 / (x + 60), and \\"Water Margin\\" is 4800 / x. So, 3600 / (x + 60) = (1/2) * (4800 / x). That looks correct.So, now, let's solve this equation step by step.First, write the equation:3600 / (x + 60) = (1/2) * (4800 / x)I can simplify the right-hand side first. Let's compute (1/2) * (4800 / x). That would be 2400 / x.So, the equation becomes:3600 / (x + 60) = 2400 / xNow, to solve for x, I can cross-multiply. That is, multiply both sides by (x + 60) and x to eliminate the denominators.So, 3600 * x = 2400 * (x + 60)Let me compute both sides.Left side: 3600xRight side: 2400x + 2400*60Compute 2400*60: 2400*60 is 144,000.So, the equation becomes:3600x = 2400x + 144,000Now, subtract 2400x from both sides to get:3600x - 2400x = 144,000Which simplifies to:1200x = 144,000Now, divide both sides by 1200:x = 144,000 / 1200Compute that: 144,000 divided by 1200.Well, 144,000 divided by 1200. Let me compute that.First, note that 1200 goes into 144,000 how many times?Well, 1200 * 100 = 120,000Subtract that from 144,000: 144,000 - 120,000 = 24,000Now, 1200 goes into 24,000 exactly 20 times because 1200*20=24,000.So, total is 100 + 20 = 120.Therefore, x = 120.So, the price of each set of \\"Water Margin\\" comic books is 120.Wait, let me verify that to make sure.If x is 120, then \\"Romance of the Three Kingdoms\\" is x + 60 = 180.Number of sets of \\"Romance\\" is 3600 / 180 = 20.Number of sets of \\"Water Margin\\" is 4800 / 120 = 40.Is 20 equal to half of 40? Yes, because half of 40 is 20. So that checks out.Therefore, the calculations seem correct.So, summarizing:1. Let x be the price of each set of \\"Water Margin\\" comic books.2. Then, the price of each set of \\"Romance of the Three Kingdoms\\" is x + 60.3. The number of sets of \\"Romance\\" purchased is 3600 / (x + 60).4. The number of sets of \\"Water Margin\\" purchased is 4800 / x.5. According to the problem, 3600 / (x + 60) = (1/2) * (4800 / x).6. Solving this equation leads to x = 120.So, the price of each set of \\"Water Margin\\" comic books is 120.I think that's the correct answer.**Final Answer**The price of each set of \\"Water Margin\\" comic books is boxed{120} dollars."},{"question":"If m and n are opposite numbers, and p and q are reciprocals, then the value of -2023m+frac{3}{{pq}}-2023n is ______.","answer":"First, I recognize that ( m ) and ( n ) are opposite numbers, which means ( m = -n ).Next, since ( p ) and ( q ) are reciprocals, it follows that ( pq = 1 ).Substituting ( m = -n ) into the expression (-2023m - 2023n), we get (-2023(-n) - 2023n), which simplifies to (2023n - 2023n = 0).For the term (frac{3}{pq}), since ( pq = 1 ), this simplifies to (3).Combining these results, the entire expression evaluates to (0 + 3 = 3)."},{"question":"Determine the value of frac{1}{sin 10^{circ}} - frac{sqrt{3}}{sin 80^{circ}}.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here: Determine the value of (frac{1}{sin 10^{circ}} - frac{sqrt{3}}{sin 80^{circ}}). Hmm, okay. Let me try to figure this out step by step.First, I know that trigonometric identities can sometimes help simplify expressions like this. Maybe I can manipulate these terms to find a common ground or use some known identities. Let me write down the expression again:[frac{1}{sin 10^{circ}} - frac{sqrt{3}}{sin 80^{circ}}]Hmm, I notice that 10 degrees and 80 degrees are complementary angles since (10^{circ} + 80^{circ} = 90^{circ}). I remember that (sin(90^{circ} - theta) = cos theta), so that means (sin 80^{circ} = sin(90^{circ} - 10^{circ}) = cos 10^{circ}). That could be useful. Let me substitute that in:[frac{1}{sin 10^{circ}} - frac{sqrt{3}}{cos 10^{circ}}]Okay, so now the expression is in terms of sine and cosine of the same angle, 10 degrees. Maybe I can combine these two terms into a single fraction. To do that, I need a common denominator. The denominators are (sin 10^{circ}) and (cos 10^{circ}), so the common denominator would be (sin 10^{circ} cos 10^{circ}). Let me rewrite each term with this common denominator.For the first term, (frac{1}{sin 10^{circ}}), I need to multiply numerator and denominator by (cos 10^{circ}):[frac{1 times cos 10^{circ}}{sin 10^{circ} times cos 10^{circ}} = frac{cos 10^{circ}}{sin 10^{circ} cos 10^{circ}}]For the second term, (frac{sqrt{3}}{cos 10^{circ}}), I need to multiply numerator and denominator by (sin 10^{circ}):[frac{sqrt{3} times sin 10^{circ}}{cos 10^{circ} times sin 10^{circ}} = frac{sqrt{3} sin 10^{circ}}{sin 10^{circ} cos 10^{circ}}]Now, both terms have the same denominator, so I can subtract the numerators:[frac{cos 10^{circ} - sqrt{3} sin 10^{circ}}{sin 10^{circ} cos 10^{circ}}]Hmm, the numerator looks familiar. It resembles the sine of a difference formula. Let me recall: (sin(A - B) = sin A cos B - cos A sin B). Wait, but in our numerator, it's (cos 10^{circ} - sqrt{3} sin 10^{circ}). Maybe I can factor something out to make it fit the sine difference formula.Let me factor out a 2 from the numerator:[cos 10^{circ} - sqrt{3} sin 10^{circ} = 2 left( frac{1}{2} cos 10^{circ} - frac{sqrt{3}}{2} sin 10^{circ} right)]Aha! Now, (frac{1}{2}) is (cos 60^{circ}) and (frac{sqrt{3}}{2}) is (sin 60^{circ}). So, substituting these in:[2 left( cos 60^{circ} cos 10^{circ} - sin 60^{circ} sin 10^{circ} right)]Now, this expression inside the parentheses is exactly the cosine of a sum formula: (cos(A + B) = cos A cos B - sin A sin B). So, applying that:[2 cos(60^{circ} + 10^{circ}) = 2 cos 70^{circ}]Great, so the numerator simplifies to (2 cos 70^{circ}). Now, let's substitute that back into our expression:[frac{2 cos 70^{circ}}{sin 10^{circ} cos 10^{circ}}]Hmm, the denominator is (sin 10^{circ} cos 10^{circ}). I remember that there's a double-angle identity for sine: (sin 2theta = 2 sin theta cos theta). So, if I let (theta = 10^{circ}), then:[sin 20^{circ} = 2 sin 10^{circ} cos 10^{circ}]Which means:[sin 10^{circ} cos 10^{circ} = frac{1}{2} sin 20^{circ}]Substituting this back into the denominator:[frac{2 cos 70^{circ}}{frac{1}{2} sin 20^{circ}} = frac{2 cos 70^{circ} times 2}{sin 20^{circ}} = frac{4 cos 70^{circ}}{sin 20^{circ}}]Wait, hold on, let me check that step again. If the denominator is (frac{1}{2} sin 20^{circ}), then dividing by that is the same as multiplying by 2. So:[frac{2 cos 70^{circ}}{frac{1}{2} sin 20^{circ}} = 2 cos 70^{circ} times frac{2}{sin 20^{circ}} = frac{4 cos 70^{circ}}{sin 20^{circ}}]Wait, that seems a bit off. Let me correct that. If I have:[frac{2 cos 70^{circ}}{frac{1}{2} sin 20^{circ}} = 2 cos 70^{circ} times frac{2}{sin 20^{circ}} = frac{4 cos 70^{circ}}{sin 20^{circ}}]Yes, that's correct. So, now the expression is (frac{4 cos 70^{circ}}{sin 20^{circ}}). Hmm, can I simplify this further?I know that (cos 70^{circ}) is equal to (sin 20^{circ}) because (cos(90^{circ} - theta) = sin theta). So, (cos 70^{circ} = sin 20^{circ}). That's perfect because then:[frac{4 cos 70^{circ}}{sin 20^{circ}} = frac{4 sin 20^{circ}}{sin 20^{circ}} = 4]Wait, so does that mean the entire expression simplifies to 4? Let me recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake.Starting with:[frac{1}{sin 10^{circ}} - frac{sqrt{3}}{sin 80^{circ}} = frac{1}{sin 10^{circ}} - frac{sqrt{3}}{cos 10^{circ}}]Combined over a common denominator:[frac{cos 10^{circ} - sqrt{3} sin 10^{circ}}{sin 10^{circ} cos 10^{circ}} = frac{2 cos 70^{circ}}{frac{1}{2} sin 20^{circ}} = frac{4 cos 70^{circ}}{sin 20^{circ}} = 4]Yes, that seems right. So, the value is 4.But just to be thorough, let me verify this with approximate values.First, calculate (sin 10^{circ}) and (sin 80^{circ}):- (sin 10^{circ} approx 0.1736)- (sin 80^{circ} approx 0.9848)So, compute each term:- (frac{1}{sin 10^{circ}} approx frac{1}{0.1736} approx 5.7588)- (frac{sqrt{3}}{sin 80^{circ}} approx frac{1.732}{0.9848} approx 1.7588)Subtracting the second term from the first:(5.7588 - 1.7588 = 4.0)So, that checks out numerically. Therefore, the value is indeed 4.I think that's solid. I used trigonometric identities step by step, simplified the expression, and even verified it numerically. So, I'm confident the answer is 4.**Final Answer**boxed{4}"},{"question":"The teacher asked 5 students: \\"How many of you reviewed math yesterday?\\" Zhang: \\"No one.\\" Li: \\"One person.\\" Wang: \\"Two people.\\" Zhao: \\"Three people.\\" Liu: \\"Four people.\\" The teacher knows that some reviewed math yesterday afternoon and some did not. Those who reviewed told the truth, and those who did not review lied. How many of these 5 people reviewed math yesterday?A. 3B. 2C. 1D. 0","answer":"Alright, so I've got this logic puzzle here, and I need to figure out how many of the five students reviewed math yesterday. The students are Zhang, Li, Wang, Zhao, and Liu. Each of them gave a different answer to the teacher's question: \\"How many of you reviewed math yesterday?\\" Their answers were:- Zhang: \\"No one.\\"- Li: \\"One person.\\"- Wang: \\"Two people.\\"- Zhao: \\"Three people.\\"- Liu: \\"Four people.\\"The teacher knows that some reviewed math and some didn't. The key point is that those who reviewed math told the truth, and those who didn't review lied. So, the ones who reviewed are truthful, and the ones who didn't review are liars.My goal is to figure out how many of these five students actually reviewed math yesterday. The options given are A. 3, B. 2, C. 1, D. 0.Hmm, okay. Let's break this down. Since each student is making a claim about how many people reviewed math, and depending on whether they reviewed or not, their statement is either true or false.Let me denote the number of students who reviewed math as N. So, N can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. But given the options, it's likely that N is one of the numbers from 0 to 4, since the options don't include 5.Wait, but the options are A.3, B.2, C.1, D.0. So, it's either 0,1,2, or 3.But let's not limit ourselves yet. Let's analyze each possibility.First, let's consider N=0. If N=0, that means no one reviewed math. So, all five students are liars. But if N=0, then the truthful statement would be \\"No one reviewed,\\" which is Zhang's statement. But if N=0, then Zhang is telling the truth, which contradicts the fact that all students are liars. Therefore, N cannot be 0.Wait, hold on. If N=0, then all students are liars, but Zhang's statement is \\"No one,\\" which would actually be the truth. So, that's a contradiction because if N=0, Zhang is truthful, but we assumed N=0 implies all are liars. Therefore, N cannot be 0.So, D is out.Next, let's consider N=1. If N=1, that means one person reviewed math, and the rest are liars.So, the truthful person would be the one who said \\"One person,\\" which is Li. So, Li is the one who reviewed math. The others, Zhang, Wang, Zhao, and Liu, are liars.Let's check their statements:- Zhang said \\"No one.\\" If Zhang is lying, then it's not true that no one reviewed. Since N=1, that's correct; Zhang is lying.- Li said \\"One person.\\" Since Li is truthful, that's correct.- Wang said \\"Two people.\\" If Wang is lying, then it's not true that two people reviewed. Since N=1, that's correct; Wang is lying.- Zhao said \\"Three people.\\" Zhao is lying, so it's not true that three people reviewed. Correct, since N=1.- Liu said \\"Four people.\\" Liu is lying, so it's not true that four people reviewed. Correct, since N=1.So, in this case, all statements are consistent with N=1. So, N=1 is a possible answer.But let's check the other options to make sure.Next, N=2. If N=2, then two people reviewed math, and the rest are liars.So, the truthful statements would be \\"Two people,\\" which is Wang's statement. So, Wang is one of the reviewers. The other reviewer would be someone else.Wait, but if N=2, then the truthful people are the ones who said \\"Two people.\\" So, Wang is truthful, and the other person who reviewed math must also be someone else. But the other person's statement must also be true. Wait, no. Only the reviewers are truthful, so if N=2, then two people are truthful, and the other three are liars.But in this case, only Wang's statement is \\"Two people.\\" So, if N=2, then Wang is truthful, but we need another person who is also truthful. However, the other students' statements are \\"No one,\\" \\"One person,\\" \\"Three people,\\" and \\"Four people.\\" None of these are equal to 2, so no one else is telling the truth. Therefore, only Wang is truthful, but N=2 would require two truthful people. Therefore, this is a contradiction. So, N cannot be 2.Wait, hold on. Let me clarify that.If N=2, then two people reviewed math, so two people are telling the truth, and three are lying. However, among the students, only Wang is making the statement \\"Two people.\\" So, only Wang is telling the truth. That means only one person is truthful, but N=2 would require two truthful people. Therefore, this is a contradiction. So, N cannot be 2.Therefore, N=2 is invalid.Next, let's check N=3. If N=3, then three people reviewed math, and the rest are liars.So, the truthful statements would be \\"Three people,\\" which is Zhao's statement. So, Zhao is one of the reviewers. We need two more people who are truthful. However, the other students' statements are \\"No one,\\" \\"One person,\\" \\"Two people,\\" and \\"Four people.\\" None of these are equal to 3, so no one else is telling the truth. Therefore, only Zhao is truthful, but N=3 would require three truthful people. Therefore, this is a contradiction. So, N cannot be 3.Wait, same logic as before. If N=3, three people are truthful, but only Zhao's statement is correct. So, only one person is truthful, which contradicts N=3. Therefore, N=3 is invalid.Lastly, let's check N=4. If N=4, then four people reviewed math, and one person is lying.So, the truthful statements would be \\"Four people,\\" which is Liu's statement. So, Liu is one of the reviewers. We need three more people who are truthful. However, the other students' statements are \\"No one,\\" \\"One person,\\" \\"Two people,\\" and \\"Three people.\\" None of these are equal to 4, so no one else is telling the truth. Therefore, only Liu is truthful, but N=4 would require four truthful people. Therefore, this is a contradiction. So, N cannot be 4.Wait, but N=4 is not one of the options, but just to be thorough, it's invalid.So, from this analysis, the only possible value is N=1. So, the answer should be C.1.But wait, let me double-check because sometimes these puzzles can be tricky.If N=1, then Li is the only one who reviewed, and he's truthful. The others are liars.Zhang said \\"No one.\\" Since he didn't review, he's lying. So, it's not true that no one reviewed, which is correct because Li did review.Li said \\"One person.\\" Since he reviewed, he's truthful, so that's correct.Wang said \\"Two people.\\" He didn't review, so he's lying. So, it's not true that two people reviewed, which is correct because only one did.Zhao said \\"Three people.\\" He didn't review, so he's lying. Correct, because only one reviewed.Liu said \\"Four people.\\" He didn't review, so he's lying. Correct, because only one reviewed.So, all statements are consistent with N=1. Therefore, N=1 is indeed the correct answer.Wait a second, but the options include A.3, B.2, C.1, D.0. So, C.1 is an option, and that's what we arrived at.But hold on, I just thought of something else. What if N=2? Earlier, I thought that only Wang would be truthful, but maybe there's another way to interpret it.Wait, if N=2, then two people are truthful. So, their statements must both be \\"Two people.\\" But only Wang said \\"Two people.\\" So, unless another person also said \\"Two people,\\" but in this case, only Wang did. Therefore, only Wang is truthful, which would mean N=1, but that contradicts N=2.Alternatively, maybe the two truthful people could have different statements? But no, because the truthful people must be telling the truth about the number of reviewers, so both would have to say \\"Two people.\\" Since only Wang did, N=2 is impossible.Therefore, N=1 is the only possibility.So, the answer is C.1.**Final Answer**boxed{C}"},{"question":"One side of a triangle is equal to the radius of its circumscribed circle. What is the measure of the opposite angle?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: \\"One side of a triangle is equal to the radius of its circumscribed circle. What is the measure of the opposite angle?\\" Hmm, interesting. Let me try to figure this out step by step.First, let me recall some basic concepts about triangles and their circumscribed circles. I remember that the radius of the circumscribed circle, often called the circumradius, is related to the sides of the triangle and its angles. There's this formula called the Law of Sines which might be useful here. Let me write that down:The Law of Sines states that in any triangle, the ratio of the length of a side to the sine of its opposite angle is equal to twice the radius of the circumscribed circle. Mathematically, this is expressed as:[frac{a}{sin A} = frac{b}{sin B} = frac{c}{sin C} = 2R]Where ( a, b, c ) are the lengths of the sides opposite angles ( A, B, C ) respectively, and ( R ) is the radius of the circumscribed circle.Okay, so the problem says that one side of the triangle is equal to the radius of its circumscribed circle. Let's denote the side as ( a ) and the opposite angle as ( A ). So, according to the problem, ( a = R ).Using the Law of Sines, we can write:[frac{a}{sin A} = 2R]But since ( a = R ), we can substitute that into the equation:[frac{R}{sin A} = 2R]Hmm, let me solve for ( sin A ). If I multiply both sides by ( sin A ), I get:[R = 2R sin A]Then, dividing both sides by ( R ) (assuming ( R neq 0 ), which makes sense because a circle with radius 0 wouldn't make a triangle), we have:[1 = 2 sin A]So, simplifying further:[sin A = frac{1}{2}]Alright, so ( sin A = frac{1}{2} ). Now, I need to find the measure of angle ( A ). I remember that the sine of an angle is ( frac{1}{2} ) at two standard angles in the range of 0 to 180 degrees, which are 30 degrees and 150 degrees. But in a triangle, all angles must be less than 180 degrees, so both are possible. However, we need to consider the context of the triangle.Wait, if one side is equal to the radius, does that impose any restrictions on the triangle? Let me think. The radius of the circumscribed circle is related to the sides and angles, but does a side being equal to the radius necessarily make the triangle acute or obtuse?Let me consider both possibilities. If ( A = 30^circ ), then the triangle could be acute. If ( A = 150^circ ), then the triangle would be obtuse. Is there a way to determine which one is the case here?Well, let's think about the Law of Sines again. If ( A = 150^circ ), then the other angles must add up to ( 30^circ ). That would make the other sides much smaller, but is that possible? Let me see.Suppose ( A = 150^circ ), then the other two angles ( B ) and ( C ) must each be less than ( 30^circ ). Using the Law of Sines, the sides opposite these angles would be ( b = 2R sin B ) and ( c = 2R sin C ). Since ( B ) and ( C ) are each less than ( 30^circ ), ( sin B ) and ( sin C ) would each be less than ( sin 30^circ = frac{1}{2} ). Therefore, ( b ) and ( c ) would each be less than ( R ), which is equal to side ( a ). So, in this case, side ( a ) is the longest side of the triangle, which is consistent with angle ( A ) being the largest angle (150 degrees).On the other hand, if ( A = 30^circ ), then the other two angles would add up to ( 150^circ ). It's possible that one of them is obtuse, say ( B = 150^circ ), but wait, that would make angle ( A ) and ( B ) both 30 and 150, but then side ( a = R ) and side ( b = 2R sin 150^circ = 2R times frac{1}{2} = R ). So, in this case, sides ( a ) and ( b ) would both be equal to ( R ), making the triangle isosceles with two sides equal to ( R ) and the third side ( c ) being ( 2R sin C ). Since ( C = 180^circ - 30^circ - 150^circ = 0^circ ), which is impossible because a triangle can't have a zero-degree angle. So, that scenario doesn't work.Wait, maybe I made a mistake there. If ( A = 30^circ ), then the other two angles must add up to ( 150^circ ). If one of them is, say, ( 100^circ ), then the third angle would be ( 50^circ ). Then, sides ( b ) and ( c ) would be ( 2R sin 100^circ ) and ( 2R sin 50^circ ). Both of these would be greater than ( R ) because ( sin 100^circ ) and ( sin 50^circ ) are both greater than ( frac{1}{2} ). So, in this case, side ( a = R ) would be the shortest side, which is consistent with angle ( A = 30^circ ) being the smallest angle.But wait, can a triangle have sides ( R ), ( 2R sin 100^circ ), and ( 2R sin 50^circ )? Let me check if the triangle inequality holds. The sum of the two smaller sides must be greater than the largest side.So, the sides are ( R ), approximately ( 2R times 0.9848 = 1.9696R ), and approximately ( 2R times 0.7660 = 1.532R ). So, the sides are roughly ( R ), ( 1.532R ), and ( 1.9696R ). The sum of the two smaller sides is ( R + 1.532R = 2.532R ), which is greater than the largest side ( 1.9696R ). So, that works.But in this case, angle ( A = 30^circ ) is possible, as is angle ( A = 150^circ ). So, how do we determine which one is the correct measure?Wait, maybe both are possible? But the problem doesn't specify whether the triangle is acute or obtuse. Hmm, that's confusing. Let me think again.Wait, if one side is equal to the radius, which is a fixed length, then depending on the angles, the triangle can be either acute or obtuse. But is there a unique solution?Wait, let me go back to the Law of Sines. If ( a = R ), then ( frac{a}{sin A} = 2R ) implies ( sin A = frac{a}{2R} = frac{R}{2R} = frac{1}{2} ). So, ( sin A = frac{1}{2} ), which as I thought earlier, gives ( A = 30^circ ) or ( 150^circ ). So, both are mathematically possible.But in the context of a triangle, both solutions are valid unless there's additional information that restricts the triangle to being acute or obtuse. Since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps both are possible? But the question is asking for \\"the measure of the opposite angle,\\" implying a unique answer.Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here. Let me think differently. Maybe using the formula for the area of a triangle in terms of the circumradius.I recall that the area ( Delta ) of a triangle can be expressed as:[Delta = frac{abc}{4R}]Where ( a, b, c ) are the sides and ( R ) is the circumradius.But in our case, one side is equal to ( R ). Let's denote ( a = R ). Then, the area becomes:[Delta = frac{R cdot b cdot c}{4R} = frac{b c}{4}]So, ( Delta = frac{b c}{4} ). Hmm, but I don't know if that helps directly.Alternatively, maybe using the formula for the area in terms of sides and angles:[Delta = frac{1}{2}ab sin C]But without more information about the other sides or angles, I might not be able to proceed this way.Wait, perhaps using the Law of Cosines? Let me recall that:[a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc cos A]Since ( a = R ), we can write:[R^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc cos A]But I don't know ( b ) or ( c ), so this might not be helpful unless I can express ( b ) and ( c ) in terms of ( R ) and the angles.Wait, from the Law of Sines, we have ( b = 2R sin B ) and ( c = 2R sin C ). So, substituting these into the equation:[R^2 = (2R sin B)^2 + (2R sin C)^2 - 2 cdot (2R sin B) cdot (2R sin C) cos A]Simplify this:[R^2 = 4R^2 sin^2 B + 4R^2 sin^2 C - 8R^2 sin B sin C cos A]Divide both sides by ( R^2 ):[1 = 4 sin^2 B + 4 sin^2 C - 8 sin B sin C cos A]Hmm, this seems complicated. Maybe there's a better approach.Wait, since ( A + B + C = 180^circ ), we can express ( B + C = 180^circ - A ). Maybe that can help.Also, from the Law of Sines, ( frac{a}{sin A} = 2R ), which we already used, and since ( a = R ), we found ( sin A = frac{1}{2} ), so ( A = 30^circ ) or ( 150^circ ).But is there a way to determine which one is correct? Maybe considering the triangle's type.If ( A = 150^circ ), then the triangle is obtuse, and the side opposite the obtuse angle is the longest side. But in our case, ( a = R ), so if ( A = 150^circ ), then ( a ) must be the longest side. But from the Law of Sines, ( a = R ), and ( b = 2R sin B ), ( c = 2R sin C ). Since ( B ) and ( C ) would each be less than ( 30^circ ), their sines would be less than ( frac{1}{2} ), so ( b ) and ( c ) would be less than ( R ). Therefore, ( a = R ) would indeed be the longest side, making the triangle obtuse.On the other hand, if ( A = 30^circ ), then ( a = R ) would be the shortest side, and the other sides ( b ) and ( c ) would be longer. Since ( B ) and ( C ) would add up to ( 150^circ ), one of them could be obtuse, but then the side opposite that angle would be longer than ( a ). So, both scenarios are possible.Wait, but if ( A = 30^circ ), and say ( B = 100^circ ), then ( C = 50^circ ). Then, sides ( b = 2R sin 100^circ approx 1.9696R ), ( c = 2R sin 50^circ approx 1.532R ), and ( a = R ). So, in this case, ( b ) is the longest side, opposite angle ( B = 100^circ ), which is obtuse. So, the triangle is obtuse, but the side opposite the 30-degree angle is the shortest.Alternatively, if ( A = 150^circ ), then ( a = R ) is the longest side, and the other sides are shorter.So, both cases are possible: the triangle can be either acute or obtuse, depending on the other angles. But the problem doesn't specify, so how can we determine the measure of angle ( A )?Wait, maybe the problem is assuming a general case, and since both 30 and 150 degrees satisfy ( sin A = frac{1}{2} ), but in a triangle, the side opposite the larger angle is longer. So, if ( a = R ), and if ( A = 150^circ ), then ( a ) is the longest side, which is consistent. If ( A = 30^circ ), then ( a ) is the shortest side, which is also consistent.But the problem doesn't give any more information about the triangle, so perhaps both answers are possible? But the question is asking for \\"the measure of the opposite angle,\\" implying a single answer. Maybe I need to consider that in a triangle, the circumradius is related to the sides, and perhaps the side being equal to the radius imposes a specific condition.Wait, let me think about the formula for the circumradius again. The formula is:[R = frac{a}{2 sin A}]Given that ( a = R ), substituting:[R = frac{R}{2 sin A}]Multiply both sides by ( 2 sin A ):[2 R sin A = R]Divide both sides by ( R ):[2 sin A = 1]So,[sin A = frac{1}{2}]Which again gives ( A = 30^circ ) or ( 150^circ ). So, mathematically, both are solutions.But perhaps in the context of a triangle, only one of them is possible. Wait, no, as I considered earlier, both are possible depending on the other angles.Hmm, maybe the problem expects the acute angle, 30 degrees, as the answer, assuming the triangle is acute unless stated otherwise. But I'm not sure if that's a valid assumption.Alternatively, maybe there's a unique solution because if ( A = 150^circ ), then the other sides would have to be less than ( R ), but in that case, the triangle would have sides ( R ), less than ( R ), and less than ( R ). But wait, can a triangle have two sides less than ( R ) and one side equal to ( R )?Wait, let me check the triangle inequality. If ( a = R ), and ( b, c < R ), then ( b + c > a ) must hold. So, ( b + c > R ). But if ( b ) and ( c ) are both less than ( R ), their sum could still be greater than ( R ). For example, if ( b = 0.6R ) and ( c = 0.6R ), then ( b + c = 1.2R > R ). So, that works.Therefore, both cases are possible. So, why does the problem ask for \\"the measure of the opposite angle\\" as if it's unique?Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again.Given that one side is equal to the radius, and using the Law of Sines, we get that the sine of the opposite angle is ( frac{1}{2} ). So, the angle is either 30 or 150 degrees. But in a triangle, the sum of angles is 180 degrees, so if one angle is 150, the other two must add up to 30, making them both acute. If one angle is 30, the other two can add up to 150, which could include an obtuse angle.But the problem doesn't specify whether the triangle is acute or obtuse. So, perhaps both are possible, but the question is asking for the measure, implying a specific answer. Maybe I need to consider the general case where the triangle is not necessarily restricted, so both 30 and 150 are possible, but perhaps the answer is 30 degrees because it's the acute angle.Wait, but in the Law of Sines, when you have ( sin A = frac{1}{2} ), you have to consider the ambiguous case. In the context of triangles, if the given side is opposite the angle, then depending on the length, you can have one or two possible triangles. But in this case, since we're given that the side is equal to the radius, and using the Law of Sines, we have two possible angles.But in the context of the circumradius, is there a restriction? Let me think.Wait, the circumradius formula is ( R = frac{a}{2 sin A} ). If ( a = R ), then ( R = frac{R}{2 sin A} ), leading to ( sin A = frac{1}{2} ). So, regardless of the triangle being acute or obtuse, the sine of the angle is ( frac{1}{2} ), so the angle can be 30 or 150 degrees.But in a triangle, only one angle can be obtuse. So, if angle ( A ) is 150 degrees, the other angles must be acute. If angle ( A ) is 30 degrees, the other angles could be acute or one could be obtuse.But the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps both are possible. However, the problem is asking for \\"the measure of the opposite angle,\\" which suggests a unique answer. Maybe I need to consider that in a triangle, the side opposite the larger angle is longer. So, if ( a = R ) is the side, and if ( A = 150^circ ), then ( a ) is the longest side, which is consistent. If ( A = 30^circ ), then ( a ) is the shortest side, which is also consistent.But without more information, I can't determine whether the triangle is acute or obtuse. So, perhaps both 30 and 150 degrees are possible measures for angle ( A ).Wait, but the problem is phrased as \\"What is the measure of the opposite angle?\\" which is singular. So, maybe it's expecting a single answer. Maybe I need to consider that in a triangle, the circumradius is related to the sides, and perhaps the side being equal to the radius imposes a specific condition that only allows one of the angles.Wait, let me think about the formula again. ( R = frac{a}{2 sin A} ). If ( a = R ), then ( R = frac{R}{2 sin A} ), so ( 2 sin A = 1 ), so ( sin A = frac{1}{2} ). So, ( A = 30^circ ) or ( 150^circ ). So, mathematically, both are solutions.But perhaps in the context of the problem, only one is possible. Maybe the triangle is such that the side equal to the radius is the smallest side, making the opposite angle 30 degrees, or the largest side, making the opposite angle 150 degrees.But without more information, I can't be sure. However, in many problems like this, unless specified otherwise, the acute angle is often the answer expected. So, maybe 30 degrees is the answer.Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed so that regardless of the triangle type, the angle is uniquely determined. But from the math, it seems both are possible.Wait, maybe I can think about specific triangles. For example, in a right-angled triangle, the circumradius is half the hypotenuse. So, if the triangle is right-angled, then the hypotenuse is ( 2R ). But in our case, one side is ( R ), which would be half the hypotenuse. So, if the triangle were right-angled, the side opposite the right angle would be ( 2R ), so the side ( R ) would be one of the legs. Then, the angle opposite ( R ) would be 30 degrees because in a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are in the ratio ( 1 : sqrt{3} : 2 ). So, the side opposite 30 degrees is ( R ), the side opposite 60 degrees is ( R sqrt{3} ), and the hypotenuse is ( 2R ).So, in this case, angle ( A ) is 30 degrees. But wait, is this triangle necessarily right-angled? The problem doesn't specify that. So, this is just one possible case where the triangle is right-angled, but the problem doesn't state that.Alternatively, if the triangle is equilateral, all sides are equal, and all angles are 60 degrees. But in that case, the circumradius ( R ) is given by ( R = frac{a}{sqrt{3}} ). So, if ( a = R ), then ( R = frac{R}{sqrt{3}} ), which implies ( sqrt{3} = 1 ), which is not true. So, the triangle can't be equilateral.Alternatively, if the triangle is isosceles with two sides equal to ( R ), then the base angles would be equal. But then, using the Law of Sines, we can find the angles. But this is getting too speculative.Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting the answer 30 degrees because it's the acute angle, and in the absence of additional information, that's the more straightforward answer. Alternatively, maybe both 30 and 150 degrees are acceptable, but the problem is expecting the acute angle.But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check my reasoning again.Given ( a = R ), using the Law of Sines:[frac{a}{sin A} = 2R implies frac{R}{sin A} = 2R implies sin A = frac{1}{2}]Thus, ( A = 30^circ ) or ( 150^circ ). Both are valid in different triangles. Since the problem doesn't specify whether the triangle is acute or obtuse, both are possible. However, the problem asks for \\"the measure of the opposite angle,\\" which is singular, so perhaps it's expecting both answers? But the way it's phrased, it's asking for \\"the measure,\\" implying a single answer.Wait, maybe I need to consider that in a triangle, if one side is equal to the radius, the triangle can't have an angle of 150 degrees because that would make the other sides too small to satisfy the triangle inequality. But earlier, I considered that if ( A = 150^circ ), then ( b ) and ( c ) would each be less than ( R ), but their sum would still be greater than ( R ), so it's possible.Wait, let me do a concrete example. Suppose ( R = 2 ). Then, ( a = 2 ). If ( A = 150^circ ), then ( b = 2R sin B = 4 sin B ), and ( c = 4 sin C ). Since ( B + C = 30^circ ), let's say ( B = 15^circ ) and ( C = 15^circ ). Then, ( b = 4 sin 15^circ approx 4 times 0.2588 = 1.035 ), and ( c = 1.035 ). So, sides are ( a = 2 ), ( b approx 1.035 ), ( c approx 1.035 ). Check triangle inequality: ( 1.035 + 1.035 = 2.07 > 2 ), so it works. Therefore, such a triangle exists.Similarly, if ( A = 30^circ ), then ( B + C = 150^circ ). Let's say ( B = 90^circ ), ( C = 60^circ ). Then, ( b = 4 sin 90^circ = 4 times 1 = 4 ), ( c = 4 sin 60^circ approx 4 times 0.8660 = 3.464 ). So, sides are ( a = 2 ), ( b = 4 ), ( c approx 3.464 ). Check triangle inequality: ( 2 + 3.464 = 5.464 > 4 ), ( 2 + 4 = 6 > 3.464 ), ( 3.464 + 4 = 7.464 > 2 ). So, that works too.Therefore, both cases are possible. So, the measure of the opposite angle can be either 30 degrees or 150 degrees. But the problem is asking for \\"the measure,\\" which is singular. Hmm.Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The problem says \\"one side of a triangle is equal to the radius of its circumscribed circle.\\" It doesn't specify whether the triangle is acute, obtuse, or right-angled. Therefore, both 30 and 150 degrees are possible measures for the opposite angle.But the problem is asking for \\"the measure,\\" which is singular. So, perhaps the answer is both 30 and 150 degrees. But in the context of the problem, is there a way to determine which one is correct?Wait, perhaps the problem is assuming that the triangle is such that the side equal to the radius is the smallest side, making the opposite angle 30 degrees. Or maybe it's the largest side, making the angle 150 degrees. But without more information, it's impossible to say.Wait, but in the formula ( R = frac{a}{2 sin A} ), if ( a = R ), then ( R = frac{R}{2 sin A} implies sin A = frac{1}{2} ). So, regardless of the triangle's type, the angle must satisfy this. So, the angle is either 30 or 150 degrees.Therefore, the measure of the opposite angle is either 30 degrees or 150 degrees. But since the problem is asking for \\"the measure,\\" maybe it's expecting both answers? Or perhaps just the acute angle.Wait, in many textbooks, when such problems are posed, they often expect the acute angle unless specified otherwise. So, maybe the answer is 30 degrees.Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed so that regardless of the triangle's type, the angle is uniquely determined. But from the math, it's clear that both are possible.Wait, maybe I can think about the area. If ( A = 30^circ ), the area would be ( frac{1}{2} times b times c times sin A ). If ( A = 150^circ ), the area would be ( frac{1}{2} times b times c times sin 150^circ ). But since ( sin 30^circ = sin 150^circ = frac{1}{2} ), the area would be the same in both cases. So, the area doesn't help us determine the angle.Hmm, I'm going in circles here. Let me try to recall if there's a standard result for this. I think that in a triangle where one side is equal to the circumradius, the opposite angle is 30 degrees. But I'm not entirely sure.Wait, let me think about the unit circle. If the circumradius is 1, then the side opposite the angle is also 1. Using the Law of Sines, ( frac{1}{sin A} = 2 times 1 implies sin A = frac{1}{2} implies A = 30^circ ) or ( 150^circ ). So, again, both are possible.But perhaps in the context of the unit circle, the triangle is considered to be in a specific orientation, making the angle 30 degrees. But I don't think that's a valid assumption.Wait, maybe the problem is from a specific source where they expect the acute angle. Alternatively, maybe the answer is 30 degrees because it's the more common case.Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the answer in radians, but the question asks for degrees, so that's not it.Wait, another approach: using the extended Law of Sines, which states that ( frac{a}{sin A} = 2R ). So, if ( a = R ), then ( frac{R}{sin A} = 2R implies sin A = frac{1}{2} ). So, ( A = 30^circ ) or ( 150^circ ). So, again, both are possible.Given that, perhaps the answer is both 30 and 150 degrees. But the problem is asking for \\"the measure,\\" which is singular. So, maybe the answer is 30 degrees because it's the acute angle, and in the absence of additional information, that's the default.Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed so that the triangle is such that the side equal to the radius is the smallest side, making the opposite angle 30 degrees.But I'm not sure. Given the ambiguity, I think the safest answer is that the measure of the opposite angle is 30 degrees or 150 degrees. But since the problem is asking for \\"the measure,\\" maybe it's expecting both answers. However, in the format requested, I need to provide a single answer.Wait, perhaps I can think about the triangle's angles. If ( A = 150^circ ), then the other two angles are each less than ( 30^circ ), which would make the triangle very \\"flat.\\" On the other hand, if ( A = 30^circ ), the triangle can have a more balanced set of angles.But without more information, I can't determine which one is the case. Therefore, I think the answer is that the measure of the opposite angle is either 30 degrees or 150 degrees.But since the problem is asking for \\"the measure,\\" maybe it's expecting both. However, in the context of the problem, perhaps only one is possible. Wait, let me think about the circumradius formula again.The formula ( R = frac{a}{2 sin A} ) must hold. If ( a = R ), then ( R = frac{R}{2 sin A} implies sin A = frac{1}{2} ). So, regardless of the triangle's type, the angle must satisfy this. So, both 30 and 150 degrees are possible.Therefore, the measure of the opposite angle is either 30 degrees or 150 degrees. But since the problem is asking for \\"the measure,\\" perhaps it's expecting both answers. However, in the format requested, I need to provide a single answer. Maybe the answer is 30 degrees because it's the acute angle, but I'm not entirely sure.Wait, perhaps the problem is from a specific source where they expect the acute angle.

However, since the problem is asking for \\"the measure,\\" maybe it's expecting both. But in the context of the problem, perhaps only one is possible.Wait, another thought: in a triangle, the circumradius is related to the sides and angles, but if one side is equal to the radius, then the triangle can't have an angle greater than 90 degrees because that would make the side opposite that angle longer than ( R ), but in our case, ( a = R ). Wait, no, because if the angle is 150 degrees, the side opposite is ( R ), which is longer than the other sides, which are less than ( R ). So, that's consistent.Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting the answer 30 degrees because it's the acute angle, and in the absence of additional information, that's the default. Alternatively, maybe the answer is 30 degrees because it's the more straightforward solution.Given that, I think I'll go with 30 degrees as the measure of the opposite angle."},{"question":"A number divided by 20 has a quotient of 10 and a remainder of 10.

Hmm, okay. Let me try to break this down step by step.First, let's parse the problem. We need to find integers ( n ) such that both ( n - 3 ) is a perfect cube and ( n^2 + 4 ) is also a perfect cube. Then, we have to sum all such integers ( n ).So, let's denote ( n - 3 = a^3 ) where ( a ) is some integer. That means ( n = a^3 + 3 ). Got that part. Now, substituting this into the second condition, we have ( n^2 + 4 = (a^3 + 3)^2 + 4 ). This expression must also be a perfect cube. Let's denote this as ( b^3 ), so:[(a^3 + 3)^2 + 4 = b^3]Our goal is to find all integers ( a ) and ( b ) such that this equation holds, and then find the corresponding ( n ) values and sum them up.Let me write this equation again:[(a^3 + 3)^2 + 4 = b^3]Let me expand the left-hand side:[(a^3 + 3)^2 = a^6 + 6a^3 + 9]So, adding 4 gives:[a^6 + 6a^3 + 13 = b^3]So, we have:[b^3 = a^6 + 6a^3 + 13]Hmm, okay. So, we need ( a^6 + 6a^3 + 13 ) to be a perfect cube. Let me think about how to approach this.Since both ( a ) and ( b ) are integers, perhaps we can consider small integer values of ( a ) and see if ( b^3 ) becomes a perfect cube. Let's try plugging in small integer values for ( a ) and see what happens.Let's start with ( a = 0 ):[b^3 = 0 + 0 + 13 = 13]13 is not a perfect cube, so ( a = 0 ) doesn't work.Next, ( a = 1 ):[b^3 = 1 + 6 + 13 = 20]20 is not a perfect cube either.How about ( a = -1 ):[b^3 = (-1)^6 + 6(-1)^3 + 13 = 1 - 6 + 13 = 8]Ah, 8 is a perfect cube since ( 2^3 = 8 ). So, ( b = 2 ) when ( a = -1 ). Therefore, ( n = a^3 + 3 = (-1)^3 + 3 = -1 + 3 = 2 ). So, ( n = 2 ) is a solution.Let me check that:( n - 3 = 2 - 3 = -1 ), which is ( (-1)^3 ), so that's good.( n^2 + 4 = 4 + 4 = 8 ), which is ( 2^3 ), perfect. So, ( n = 2 ) is indeed a solution.Okay, moving on. Let's try ( a = 2 ):[b^3 = 64 + 48 + 13 = 125]125 is a perfect cube, since ( 5^3 = 125 ). So, ( b = 5 ) when ( a = 2 ). Therefore, ( n = a^3 + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11 ). So, ( n = 11 ) is another solution.Checking:( n - 3 = 11 - 3 = 8 = 2^3 ), good.( n^2 + 4 = 121 + 4 = 125 = 5^3 ), perfect. So, ( n = 11 ) is also a solution.Great, so far we have two solutions: 2 and 11.Let's try ( a = -2 ):[b^3 = (-2)^6 + 6(-2)^3 + 13 = 64 - 48 + 13 = 29]29 is not a perfect cube.How about ( a = 3 ):[b^3 = 729 + 162 + 13 = 904]904 is not a perfect cube. Let me check: ( 9^3 = 729 ), ( 10^3 = 1000 ), so 904 is between them, not a cube.( a = -3 ):[b^3 = (-3)^6 + 6(-3)^3 + 13 = 729 - 162 + 13 = 580]580 isn't a cube either. ( 8^3 = 512 ), ( 9^3 = 729 ), so 580 is in between.Moving on to ( a = 4 ):[b^3 = 4096 + 384 + 13 = 4493]4493 is way beyond, let's see: ( 16^3 = 4096 ), ( 17^3 = 4913 ). So, 4493 is between them, not a cube.( a = -4 ):[b^3 = (-4)^6 + 6(-4)^3 + 13 = 4096 - 384 + 13 = 3725]3725 is between ( 15^3 = 3375 ) and ( 16^3 = 4096 ), so not a cube.Hmm, seems like as ( |a| ) increases, ( a^6 ) grows much faster than ( 6a^3 ), so the value of ( b^3 ) is getting too large and not hitting perfect cubes. Maybe I should check a few more values just to be thorough.( a = 5 ):[b^3 = 15625 + 750 + 13 = 16388]16388 is between ( 25^3 = 15625 ) and ( 26^3 = 17576 ), so not a cube.( a = -5 ):[b^3 = (-5)^6 + 6(-5)^3 + 13 = 15625 - 750 + 13 = 14888]14888 is between ( 24^3 = 13824 ) and ( 25^3 = 15625 ), so not a cube.Okay, maybe ( a = 6 ):[b^3 = 46656 + 1296 + 13 = 48065]48065 is between ( 36^3 = 46656 ) and ( 37^3 = 50653 ), so not a cube.( a = -6 ):[b^3 = (-6)^6 + 6(-6)^3 + 13 = 46656 - 1296 + 13 = 45373]45373 is between ( 35^3 = 42875 ) and ( 36^3 = 46656 ), so not a cube.Hmm, it's getting pretty big, and the gaps between consecutive cubes are increasing. Maybe it's unlikely that we'll find more solutions beyond ( a = 2 ) and ( a = -1 ). But just to be safe, let me check ( a = 7 ):[b^3 = 117649 + 2058 + 13 = 119720]119720 is between ( 49^3 = 117649 ) and ( 50^3 = 125000 ), not a cube.( a = -7 ):[b^3 = (-7)^6 + 6(-7)^3 + 13 = 117649 - 2058 + 13 = 115604]115604 is between ( 48^3 = 110592 ) and ( 49^3 = 117649 ), so not a cube.Alright, maybe I should try ( a = 1 ) again, but wait, I already did that. It gave 20, which isn't a cube. Let me think if there's another approach.Alternatively, maybe I can consider the equation ( b^3 = a^6 + 6a^3 + 13 ) and see if I can factor it or find some relationship.Let me denote ( x = a^3 ), then the equation becomes:[b^3 = x^2 + 6x + 13]So, we have ( b^3 = x^2 + 6x + 13 ). Hmm, perhaps I can complete the square on the right-hand side.Completing the square for ( x^2 + 6x ):[x^2 + 6x = (x + 3)^2 - 9]So, substituting back:[b^3 = (x + 3)^2 - 9 + 13 = (x + 3)^2 + 4]Therefore, the equation becomes:[b^3 = (x + 3)^2 + 4]But ( x = a^3 ), so:[b^3 = (a^3 + 3)^2 + 4]Wait, that's just the original equation. Hmm, so maybe that approach didn't help much.Alternatively, perhaps I can think of ( b^3 ) as being close to ( (a^3 + 3)^2 ). So, let's denote ( c = a^3 + 3 ), then ( b^3 = c^2 + 4 ). So, we have ( b^3 - c^2 = 4 ).Hmm, so ( b^3 - c^2 = 4 ). Maybe I can look for integer solutions to this equation.This is a type of Diophantine equation. Let's see, for small integers ( b ) and ( c ), does ( b^3 - c^2 = 4 ) hold?Let me try small values of ( b ):- ( b = 0 ): ( 0 - c^2 = 4 ) ‚Üí ( c^2 = -4 ), no solution.- ( b = 1 ): ( 1 - c^2 = 4 ) ‚Üí ( c^2 = -3 ), no solution.- ( b = 2 ): ( 8 - c^2 = 4 ) ‚Üí ( c^2 = 4 ) ‚Üí ( c = pm 2 ).- ( b = 3 ): ( 27 - c^2 = 4 ) ‚Üí ( c^2 = 23 ), not a square.- ( b = 4 ): ( 64 - c^2 = 4 ) ‚Üí ( c^2 = 60 ), not a square.- ( b = 5 ): ( 125 - c^2 = 4 ) ‚Üí ( c^2 = 121 ) ‚Üí ( c = pm 11 ).- ( b = 6 ): ( 216 - c^2 = 4 ) ‚Üí ( c^2 = 212 ), not a square.- ( b = 7 ): ( 343 - c^2 = 4 ) ‚Üí ( c^2 = 339 ), not a square.- ( b = 8 ): ( 512 - c^2 = 4 ) ‚Üí ( c^2 = 508 ), not a square.- ( b = 9 ): ( 729 - c^2 = 4 ) ‚Üí ( c^2 = 725 ), not a square.- ( b = 10 ): ( 1000 - c^2 = 4 ) ‚Üí ( c^2 = 996 ), not a square.Similarly, for negative ( b ):- ( b = -1 ): ( -1 - c^2 = 4 ) ‚Üí ( c^2 = -5 ), no solution.- ( b = -2 ): ( -8 - c^2 = 4 ) ‚Üí ( c^2 = -12 ), no solution.- ( b = -3 ): ( -27 - c^2 = 4 ) ‚Üí ( c^2 = -31 ), no solution.So, the only solutions for ( b ) in this equation are ( b = 2 ) and ( b = 5 ), giving ( c = pm 2 ) and ( c = pm 11 ) respectively.But remember, ( c = a^3 + 3 ). So, let's consider each case:1. When ( b = 2 ), ( c = 2 ) or ( c = -2 ).   - If ( c = 2 ): ( a^3 + 3 = 2 ) ‚Üí ( a^3 = -1 ) ‚Üí ( a = -1 ).   - If ( c = -2 ): ( a^3 + 3 = -2 ) ‚Üí ( a^3 = -5 ). But ( -5 ) is not a perfect cube, so no integer ( a ) satisfies this.2. When ( b = 5 ), ( c = 11 ) or ( c = -11 ).   - If ( c = 11 ): ( a^3 + 3 = 11 ) ‚Üí ( a^3 = 8 ) ‚Üí ( a = 2 ).   - If ( c = -11 ): ( a^3 + 3 = -11 ) ‚Üí ( a^3 = -14 ). Again, ( -14 ) is not a perfect cube, so no integer ( a ) satisfies this.Therefore, the only solutions are when ( a = -1 ) and ( a = 2 ), leading to ( n = 2 ) and ( n = 11 ) respectively.Wait, but earlier when I tried ( a = -1 ), I got ( n = 2 ), and when ( a = 2 ), I got ( n = 11 ). So, these are the only solutions.But just to make sure, let me check if there are any other possible ( b ) beyond ( b = 5 ) that could satisfy ( b^3 - c^2 = 4 ). From the earlier trials, ( b = 5 ) gives ( c = 11 ), which is valid, but higher ( b ) values don't seem to give integer ( c ). So, I think we've covered all possible cases.Therefore, the integers ( n ) that satisfy both conditions are 2 and 11. Their sum is ( 2 + 11 = 13 ).Wait, hold on a second. Let me just verify if there are any other possible ( a ) values that I might have missed. For example, when ( a = 1 ), we had ( b^3 = 20 ), which isn't a cube. Similarly, ( a = -2 ) gave ( b^3 = 29 ), not a cube. So, no, I think we've covered all small ( a ) values, and beyond that, the numbers get too big without hitting perfect cubes.So, yeah, I think the only solutions are ( n = 2 ) and ( n = 11 ), so their sum is 13.**Final Answer**The sum of all such integers ( n ) is boxed{13}."},{"question":"By arbitrarily rearranging the digits of the five-digit number 12345, how many prime numbers can be obtained?(A) 4  (B) 8  (C) 12  (D) 0 (Chinese Junior High School Mathematics Competition, Jiangsu Province, 1986)","answer":"Alright, so I came across this math competition problem, and it's about figuring out how many prime numbers can be obtained by rearranging the digits of the five-digit number 12345. The options given are 4, 8, 12, or 0. Hmm, interesting. Let me try to work through this step by step.First off, I know that a prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. So, my task is to rearrange the digits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 in every possible way and check which of those permutations result in a prime number. But wait, that sounds like a lot of work because there are 5 digits, so the number of permutations is 5 factorial, which is 120. Checking all 120 numbers for primality seems tedious. Maybe there's a smarter way to approach this.Let me recall some divisibility rules that might help eliminate some numbers without having to check each one individually. The most common ones are for 2, 3, 5, and maybe 11. Starting with divisibility by 2: If a number ends with an even digit, it's divisible by 2. So, any permutation of 12345 that ends with 2, 4 will be even and hence not prime (except for 2 itself, but since we're dealing with five-digit numbers, they can't be 2). So, right away, we can eliminate all permutations ending with 2 or 4.Similarly, for divisibility by 5: If a number ends with 0 or 5, it's divisible by 5. Since 0 isn't one of our digits, only numbers ending with 5 are divisible by 5. So, any permutation ending with 5 will be divisible by 5 and hence not prime (unless the number itself is 5, which again isn't a five-digit number). So, we can eliminate all permutations ending with 5 as well.Wait, so that leaves us with permutations ending with 1 or 3. Because those are the only digits left that aren't 2, 4, or 5. So, we can narrow down our candidates to numbers ending with 1 or 3. That should reduce the number of cases we need to check.How many such permutations are there? For each ending digit, the other four digits can be arranged in 4! = 24 ways. So, for ending with 1, we have 24 numbers, and for ending with 3, another 24. That's 48 numbers in total. Still, 48 is a lot, but maybe manageable if we can find some patterns or apply more divisibility rules.Next, let's think about divisibility by 3. A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits 1+2+3+4+5 is 15, which is divisible by 3. So, regardless of how we rearrange the digits, the sum remains 15, which is divisible by 3. Therefore, every permutation of 12345 is divisible by 3. Wait, hold on. If every permutation is divisible by 3, then none of them can be prime unless the number itself is 3. But since we're dealing with five-digit numbers, none of them can be 3. Therefore, does that mean that none of the permutations are prime?But that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check my reasoning. The sum of the digits is 15, which is divisible by 3, so any number formed by these digits will also be divisible by 3. Therefore, all permutations are divisible by 3, meaning none can be prime because primes have only two distinct positive divisors: 1 and themselves. Since all these numbers are divisible by 3, they can't be prime unless they are 3, which isn't the case here.So, does that mean the answer is 0? That is, there are no prime numbers obtainable by rearranging the digits of 12345. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything.Wait, another thought: Maybe I should consider whether the number could be 3 itself, but as I thought earlier, 3 is a single-digit number, and we're dealing with five-digit numbers. So, that's not possible. Therefore, all permutations are divisible by 3 and greater than 3, hence composite.But just to be thorough, let me think about whether any of the permutations could be prime despite being divisible by 3. For example, 3 is prime, but as I said, it's not a five-digit number. Any other primes? No, because primes are only divisible by 1 and themselves. If a number is divisible by 3 and is greater than 3, it can't be prime.Therefore, all permutations of 12345 are composite, meaning the number of primes obtainable is 0.Wait, but the options given are (A) 4, (B) 8, (C) 12, (D) 0. So, 0 is an option, which would be D.But just to make sure, let me think if there's any way a permutation could not be divisible by 3. But since the sum of the digits is 15, which is divisible by 3, every permutation will have a digit sum of 15, hence divisible by 3. So, no permutation can be prime.Therefore, the answer should be D) 0.**Final Answer**boxed{D}"},{"question":"If the number (100^{10}) is written as the sum of tens ((10+10+10+ldots)), how many terms will there be?","answer":"To determine how many tens are needed to sum up to (100^{10}), I start by calculating the value of (100^{10}).Since (100) is equal to (10^2), raising it to the 10th power gives (10^{20}).Next, I recognize that each term in the sum is (10), so to find the number of terms required, I divide the total sum by the value of each term.Dividing (10^{20}) by (10) results in (10^{19}).Therefore, there will be (10^{19}) terms in the sum."},{"question":"Determine the sum of the first sixty natural numbers.","answer":"To determine the sum of the first sixty natural numbers, I can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.First, I identify the number of terms, which is 60.Next, I note that the first term is 1 and the last term is 60.Using the formula, the sum is calculated by multiplying the number of terms by the average of the first and last terms.Finally, I perform the calculation to find the total sum."},{"question":"Calculate 2 - 2^2 - 2^3 - 2^4 - 2^5 - 2^6 - 2^7 - 2^8 - 2^9 + 2^{10}.","answer":"Okay, so I need to calculate this expression: 2 - 2¬≤ - 2¬≥ - 2‚Å¥ - 2‚Åµ - 2‚Å∂ - 2‚Å∑ - 2‚Å∏ - 2‚Åπ + 2¬π‚Å∞. Hmm, that's a bit of a mouthful. Let me break it down step by step. Maybe if I write out each term individually, it'll make more sense.First, let's list out all the terms:1. 22. -2¬≤3. -2¬≥4. -2‚Å¥5. -2‚Åµ6. -2‚Å∂7. -2‚Å∑8. -2‚Å∏9. -2‚Åπ10. +2¬π‚Å∞So, starting with 2, then subtracting each power of 2 from 2¬≤ up to 2‚Åπ, and then adding 2¬π‚Å∞ at the end. Maybe I can compute each term separately and then add them all together.Let me compute each power of 2:- 2¬≤ = 4- 2¬≥ = 8- 2‚Å¥ = 16- 2‚Åµ = 32- 2‚Å∂ = 64- 2‚Å∑ = 128- 2‚Å∏ = 256- 2‚Åπ = 512- 2¬π‚Å∞ = 1024So, substituting these back into the expression, we get:2 - 4 - 8 - 16 - 32 - 64 - 128 - 256 - 512 + 1024Now, let's compute this step by step. Maybe I can group the negative terms together and then add the positive ones.First, let's compute the sum of all the negative terms:-4 -8 -16 -32 -64 -128 -256 -512Hmm, that's a lot of negative numbers. Let me add them one by one.Starting with -4:-4Then subtract 8: -4 -8 = -12Subtract 16: -12 -16 = -28Subtract 32: -28 -32 = -60Subtract 64: -60 -64 = -124Subtract 128: -124 -128 = -252Subtract 256: -252 -256 = -508Subtract 512: -508 -512 = -1020So, the sum of all the negative terms is -1020.Now, the positive terms are just 2 and +1024.So, adding those together: 2 + 1024 = 1026Now, combining the positive and negative sums:1026 (positive) + (-1020) (negative) = 1026 - 1020 = 6Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere.Let me recalculate the sum of the negative terms:-4 -8 -16 -32 -64 -128 -256 -512Let me add them in pairs to make it easier:First pair: -4 -8 = -12Second pair: -16 -32 = -48Third pair: -64 -128 = -192Fourth pair: -256 -512 = -768Now, add these results together:-12 -48 = -60-60 -192 = -252-252 -768 = -1020Okay, that still adds up to -1020. So that part seems correct.Now, the positive terms: 2 + 1024 = 1026. That seems right too.So, 1026 - 1020 = 6. Hmm, so the final result is 6? That seems surprisingly small given the large exponents involved. Maybe I should approach this differently to confirm.Alternatively, perhaps I can factor out a common term or recognize a pattern in the series.Looking at the expression: 2 - 2¬≤ - 2¬≥ - 2‚Å¥ - 2‚Åµ - 2‚Å∂ - 2‚Å∑ - 2‚Å∏ - 2‚Åπ + 2¬π‚Å∞Notice that from 2¬≤ to 2‚Åπ, these are consecutive powers of 2. Maybe I can express this as a geometric series.Wait, the expression is 2 minus the sum from 2¬≤ to 2‚Åπ plus 2¬π‚Å∞.So, let's write it as:2 - (2¬≤ + 2¬≥ + 2‚Å¥ + 2‚Åµ + 2‚Å∂ + 2‚Å∑ + 2‚Å∏ + 2‚Åπ) + 2¬π‚Å∞Yes, that's another way to look at it. So, if I can compute the sum inside the parentheses, which is a geometric series, then I can subtract that sum from 2 and then add 2¬π‚Å∞.The sum S = 2¬≤ + 2¬≥ + ... + 2‚Åπ is a geometric series with first term a = 2¬≤ = 4, common ratio r = 2, and number of terms n = 8 (from exponent 2 to 9 inclusive).The formula for the sum of a geometric series is S = a*(r^n - 1)/(r - 1)Plugging in the values:S = 4*(2^8 - 1)/(2 - 1) = 4*(256 - 1)/1 = 4*255 = 1020So, the sum from 2¬≤ to 2‚Åπ is 1020.Therefore, the original expression becomes:2 - 1020 + 2¬π‚Å∞We know that 2¬π‚Å∞ is 1024, so:2 - 1020 + 1024Compute 2 + 1024 first: 2 + 1024 = 1026Then subtract 1020: 1026 - 1020 = 6So, same result as before. That seems consistent.But just to be thorough, let me compute the entire expression step by step without grouping:Starting with 2.2 - 4 = -2-2 -8 = -10-10 -16 = -26-26 -32 = -58-58 -64 = -122-122 -128 = -250-250 -256 = -506-506 -512 = -1018-1018 + 1024 = 6Yes, that also gives 6. So, three different methods all leading to the same answer, 6. That gives me confidence that the result is correct.Alternatively, another approach is to factor out 2 from the entire expression, but I'm not sure if that would simplify things. Let me try:Original expression: 2 - 2¬≤ - 2¬≥ - 2‚Å¥ - 2‚Åµ - 2‚Å∂ - 2‚Å∑ - 2‚Å∏ - 2‚Åπ + 2¬π‚Å∞Factor out 2:2*(1 - 2 - 2¬≤ - 2¬≥ - 2‚Å¥ - 2‚Åµ - 2‚Å∂ - 2‚Å∑ - 2‚Å∏) + 2¬π‚Å∞Wait, that might complicate things more. Let me see:Inside the parentheses: 1 - 2 - 4 - 8 - 16 - 32 - 64 - 128 - 256Compute that:1 - 2 = -1-1 -4 = -5-5 -8 = -13-13 -16 = -29-29 -32 = -61-61 -64 = -125-125 -128 = -253-253 -256 = -509So, the expression becomes 2*(-509) + 1024 = -1018 + 1024 = 6Same result again. So, no matter how I approach it, the answer is 6.I think I've verified it sufficiently. It's always good to check the calculations multiple ways to avoid any arithmetic errors, especially with exponents which can get large quickly.So, after computing step by step, recognizing the geometric series, and factoring, all methods lead to the same conclusion. Therefore, I'm confident the answer is 6.**Final Answer**The value of the expression is boxed{6}."},{"question":"If (1+x+x^2)^6 = a_0 + a_1x + a_2x^2 + ldots + a_{12}x^{12}, then find the value of a_2 + a_4 + ldots + a_{12}.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the sum of the even-indexed coefficients in the expansion of (1 + x + x¬≤)^6. The expansion is given as a_0 + a_1x + a_2x¬≤ + ... + a_{12}x^{12}, and I need to find a_2 + a_4 + ... + a_{12}. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that when dealing with polynomial expansions, there are some tricks to find sums of coefficients. One common method is to plug in specific values for x and then manipulate the results. For example, plugging in x = 1 gives the sum of all coefficients, and plugging in x = -1 can sometimes help find the difference between even and odd coefficients.Let me write down what I know:The polynomial is (1 + x + x¬≤)^6. When expanded, it's equal to a_0 + a_1x + a_2x¬≤ + ... + a_{12}x^{12}.I need the sum of the even-indexed coefficients: a_0 + a_2 + a_4 + ... + a_{12}. Wait, actually, the problem says a_2 + a_4 + ... + a_{12}, which excludes a_0. Hmm, so maybe I need to adjust for that.Let me recall that the sum of all coefficients is obtained by plugging in x = 1. So, if I set x = 1, the left side becomes (1 + 1 + 1)^6 = 3^6. The right side becomes a_0 + a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_{12}. So, 3^6 = sum_{k=0}^{12} a_k.Similarly, if I plug in x = -1, the left side becomes (1 - 1 + 1)^6 = (1)^6 = 1. The right side becomes a_0 - a_1 + a_2 - a_3 + ... + a_{12}(-1)^{12}. Since 12 is even, the last term is positive. So, 1 = a_0 - a_1 + a_2 - a_3 + ... + a_{12}.Now, if I add these two equations together:(3^6) + 1 = (a_0 + a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_{12}) + (a_0 - a_1 + a_2 - ... + a_{12}).On the right side, the odd terms cancel out because a_1 - a_1 = 0, a_3 - a_3 = 0, etc., and the even terms double: 2(a_0 + a_2 + a_4 + ... + a_{12}).So, (3^6 + 1)/2 = sum of even-indexed coefficients.But wait, the problem asks for a_2 + a_4 + ... + a_{12}, which is the sum of even-indexed coefficients excluding a_0. So, I need to subtract a_0 from the sum I just found.But what is a_0? That's the constant term in the expansion. In the expansion of (1 + x + x¬≤)^6, the constant term is just 1^6 = 1, since all the x terms are raised to the 0 power. So, a_0 = 1.Therefore, the sum a_2 + a_4 + ... + a_{12} is equal to [(3^6 + 1)/2] - 1.Let me compute that step by step.First, calculate 3^6. 3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 9, 3^3 = 27, 3^4 = 81, 3^5 = 243, 3^6 = 729.So, 3^6 = 729.Then, 729 + 1 = 730.Divide that by 2: 730 / 2 = 365.So, the sum of all even-indexed coefficients (including a_0) is 365.But we need to exclude a_0, which is 1. So, 365 - 1 = 364.Therefore, the value of a_2 + a_4 + ... + a_{12} is 364.Wait a second, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.1. I found that plugging in x = 1 gives the sum of all coefficients: 3^6 = 729.2. Plugging in x = -1 gives 1 = sum of even-indexed coefficients minus sum of odd-indexed coefficients.3. Adding these two equations: 729 + 1 = 2*(sum of even-indexed coefficients). So, 730 = 2*(sum of even-indexed coefficients). Therefore, sum of even-indexed coefficients is 365.4. Since a_0 is 1, subtracting that gives 364.Yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think about generating functions or combinatorial interpretations, but this method seems straightforward and less error-prone.Alternatively, another way to think about it is using roots of unity. For a polynomial P(x), the sum of coefficients can be found by evaluating P(1), and the sum of even-indexed coefficients can be found by (P(1) + P(-1))/2. Similarly, the sum of odd-indexed coefficients is (P(1) - P(-1))/2.So, in this case, P(x) = (1 + x + x¬≤)^6.Sum of even-indexed coefficients = [P(1) + P(-1)] / 2 = (729 + 1)/2 = 730/2 = 365.Again, since a_0 is 1, subtracting it gives 364.Alternatively, if I didn't remember this trick, I might have tried expanding the polynomial, but that would be tedious for the 6th power. Instead, using these substitutions is much more efficient.I think that's solid. So, the answer should be 364.**Final Answer**The value of (a_2 + a_4 + ldots + a_{12}) is boxed{364}."},{"question":"Simplify frac{11!}{9! + 2cdot 8!}","answer":"To simplify the expression (frac{11!}{9! + 2 cdot 8!}), I start by recognizing the factorial relationships.

Next, I rewrite the denominator using these relationships: (9! + 2 cdot 8! = 9 times 8! + 2 times 8! = (9 + 2) times 8! = 11 times 8!).Now, the expression becomes (frac{11 times 10 times 9!}{11 times 8!}).

I need to find all pairs ((a, b)) that satisfy this equation.Let me start by plugging in some small natural numbers for (a) and (b) to see if I can find any solutions.First, let's try (a = 1). Then the equation becomes:(1^{b} + 1 + b = b^{1})Simplify that:(1 + 1 + b = b)Which simplifies to:(2 + b = b)Subtract (b) from both sides:(2 = 0)Wait, that doesn't make sense. So (a = 1) doesn't work. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again.(1^{b}) is always 1, so (1 + 1 + b = b). That's (2 + b = b), which implies (2 = 0). Yeah, that's impossible. So no solution when (a = 1).Okay, let's try (a = 2). Then the equation becomes:(2^{b} + 2 + b = b^{2})Hmm, let's compute this for small values of (b).Start with (b = 1):Left side: (2^{1} + 2 + 1 = 2 + 2 + 1 = 5)Right side: (1^{2} = 1)5 ‚â† 1, so not a solution.Next, (b = 2):Left side: (2^{2} + 2 + 2 = 4 + 2 + 2 = 8)Right side: (2^{2} = 4)8 ‚â† 4, so nope.(b = 3):Left: (2^{3} + 2 + 3 = 8 + 2 + 3 = 13)Right: (3^{2} = 9)13 ‚â† 9.(b = 4):Left: (2^{4} + 2 + 4 = 16 + 2 + 4 = 22)Right: (4^{2} = 16)22 ‚â† 16.(b = 5):Left: (2^{5} + 2 + 5 = 32 + 2 + 5 = 39)Right: (5^{2} = 25)39 ‚â† 25.Hmm, seems like as (b) increases, (2^{b}) grows exponentially, while (b^{2}) grows quadratically. So the left side will outpace the right side. Maybe (a = 2) doesn't have a solution either.Wait, let's check (b = 0). But natural numbers usually start at 1, so (b = 0) is probably not allowed. So, no solution for (a = 2).Moving on to (a = 3). Then the equation is:(3^{b} + 3 + b = b^{3})Again, let's try small (b) values.(b = 1):Left: (3^{1} + 3 + 1 = 3 + 3 + 1 = 7)Right: (1^{3} = 1)7 ‚â† 1.(b = 2):Left: (3^{2} + 3 + 2 = 9 + 3 + 2 = 14)Right: (2^{3} = 8)14 ‚â† 8.(b = 3):Left: (3^{3} + 3 + 3 = 27 + 3 + 3 = 33)Right: (3^{3} = 27)33 ‚â† 27.(b = 4):Left: (3^{4} + 3 + 4 = 81 + 3 + 4 = 88)Right: (4^{3} = 64)88 ‚â† 64.(b = 5):Left: (3^{5} + 3 + 5 = 243 + 3 + 5 = 251)Right: (5^{3} = 125)251 ‚â† 125.Again, the left side is growing much faster because of (3^{b}). So, maybe (a = 3) doesn't work either.Let's try (a = 4). Equation becomes:(4^{b} + 4 + b = b^{4})Testing (b = 1):Left: (4 + 4 + 1 = 9)Right: (1 = 1)9 ‚â† 1.(b = 2):Left: (16 + 4 + 2 = 22)Right: (16)22 ‚â† 16.(b = 3):Left: (64 + 4 + 3 = 71)Right: (81)71 ‚â† 81.(b = 4):Left: (256 + 4 + 4 = 264)Right: (256)264 ‚â† 256.(b = 5):Left: (1024 + 4 + 5 = 1033)Right: (625)1033 ‚â† 625.Hmm, interesting. For (a = 4), when (b = 3), left side is 71 and right is 81. So left is less than right. For (b = 4), left is 264 vs right 256. So now left is greater. So maybe somewhere between (b = 3) and (b = 4), but since (b) must be integer, no solution here.Wait, but (b = 4) gives left > right, (b = 3) gives left < right. So maybe no solution for (a = 4).Moving on to (a = 5):Equation: (5^{b} + 5 + b = b^{5})Testing (b = 1):Left: (5 + 5 + 1 = 11)Right: 111 ‚â† 1.(b = 2):Left: (25 + 5 + 2 = 32)Right: 32Wait, 32 = 32! So that's a solution: (a = 5), (b = 2).Wait, let me double-check:Left: (5^{2} + 5 + 2 = 25 + 5 + 2 = 32)Right: (2^{5} = 32)Yes, that works. So ((5, 2)) is a solution.Let me see if there are more solutions for (a = 5).(b = 3):Left: (125 + 5 + 3 = 133)Right: (243)133 ‚â† 243.(b = 4):Left: (625 + 5 + 4 = 634)Right: (1024)634 ‚â† 1024.(b = 5):Left: (3125 + 5 + 5 = 3135)Right: (3125)3135 ‚â† 3125.So only (b = 2) works for (a = 5).Wait, let's check (b = 0), but again, natural numbers start at 1, so (b = 0) is invalid.So, so far, I have one solution: ((5, 2)).Let me try (a = 6):Equation: (6^{b} + 6 + b = b^{6})Testing (b = 1):Left: (6 + 6 + 1 = 13)Right: 113 ‚â† 1.(b = 2):Left: (36 + 6 + 2 = 44)Right: 6444 ‚â† 64.(b = 3):Left: (216 + 6 + 3 = 225)Right: 729225 ‚â† 729.(b = 4):Left: (1296 + 6 + 4 = 1306)Right: 40961306 ‚â† 4096.(b = 5):Left: (7776 + 6 + 5 = 7787)Right: 156257787 ‚â† 15625.(b = 6):Left: (46656 + 6 + 6 = 46668)Right: 4665646668 ‚â† 46656.So, no solution for (a = 6).Wait, (b = 6) gives left side 46668 vs right 46656. Close, but not equal.Hmm, maybe (a = 6) doesn't have a solution.Let me try (a = 7):Equation: (7^{b} + 7 + b = b^{7})Testing (b = 1):Left: (7 + 7 + 1 = 15)Right: 115 ‚â† 1.(b = 2):Left: (49 + 7 + 2 = 58)Right: 12858 ‚â† 128.(b = 3):Left: (343 + 7 + 3 = 353)Right: 2187353 ‚â† 2187.(b = 4):Left: (2401 + 7 + 4 = 2412)Right: 163842412 ‚â† 16384.(b = 5):Left: (16807 + 7 + 5 = 16819)Right: 7812516819 ‚â† 78125.(b = 6):Left: (117649 + 7 + 6 = 117662)Right: 279936117662 ‚â† 279936.(b = 7):Left: (823543 + 7 + 7 = 823557)Right: 823543823557 ‚â† 823543.So, no solution for (a = 7).Wait, (b = 7) gives left side 823557 vs right 823543. Close, but not equal.Hmm, maybe (a = 7) doesn't have a solution.Let me try (a = 8):Equation: (8^{b} + 8 + b = b^{8})Testing (b = 1):Left: (8 + 8 + 1 = 17)Right: 117 ‚â† 1.(b = 2):Left: (64 + 8 + 2 = 74)Right: 25674 ‚â† 256.(b = 3):Left: (512 + 8 + 3 = 523)Right: 6561523 ‚â† 6561.(b = 4):Left: (4096 + 8 + 4 = 4108)Right: 655364108 ‚â† 65536.(b = 5):Left: (32768 + 8 + 5 = 32781)Right: 39062532781 ‚â† 390625.(b = 6):Left: (262144 + 8 + 6 = 262158)Right: 1679616262158 ‚â† 1679616.(b = 7):Left: (2097152 + 8 + 7 = 2097167)Right: 57648012097167 ‚â† 5764801.(b = 8):Left: (16777216 + 8 + 8 = 16777232)Right: 1677721616777232 ‚â† 16777216.So, no solution for (a = 8). The left side is just a bit larger than the right when (b = 8).Hmm, maybe I should try swapping (a) and (b). Because in the equation, (a) and (b) are kind of symmetric in a way, except for the exponents. So maybe if ((a, b)) is a solution, then ((b, a)) might also be a solution? Let me check.We found that ((5, 2)) is a solution. Let's see if ((2, 5)) is a solution.Plug into the equation:Left side: (2^{5} + 2 + 5 = 32 + 2 + 5 = 39)Right side: (5^{2} = 25)39 ‚â† 25, so nope. So ((2, 5)) is not a solution.Hmm, okay, so the equation isn't symmetric in that way.Wait, maybe I should consider cases where (a = b). Let's see.If (a = b), then the equation becomes:(a^{a} + a + a = a^{a})Simplify:(a^{a} + 2a = a^{a})Subtract (a^{a}) from both sides:(2a = 0)Which implies (a = 0), but (a) is a natural number, so (a = 0) is invalid. Therefore, there are no solutions where (a = b).Okay, so (a) cannot equal (b).Let me think about other approaches. Maybe I can rearrange the equation.Original equation: (a^{b} + a + b = b^{a})Let me write it as:(a^{b} - b^{a} + a + b = 0)Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe I can factor something out or find some inequality.I know that for (a, b > e) (where (e) is the base of natural logarithm, approximately 2.718), the function (x^{y}) grows faster than (y^{x}) if (x > y). Wait, actually, it's more complicated than that.Wait, for example, (2^3 = 8) vs (3^2 = 9). So (3^2 > 2^3). Similarly, (2^4 = 16) vs (4^2 = 16). They are equal. (2^5 = 32) vs (5^2 = 25). Now (2^5 > 5^2).So, for (a = 2), when (b = 3), (2^3 < 3^2); when (b = 4), (2^4 = 4^2); when (b = 5), (2^5 > 5^2). So, the point where (a^b) overtakes (b^a) is somewhere around (b = 4) for (a = 2).Similarly, for (a = 3), when does (3^b) overtake (b^3)?Let me see:(b = 1): (3^1 = 3), (1^3 = 1). So (3 > 1).(b = 2): (9 > 8).(b = 3): Equal.(b = 4): (81 > 64).So, for (a = 3), (3^b) is always greater than (b^3) for (b geq 1), except when (b = 3), they are equal.Wait, no, when (b = 1), (3^1 = 3 > 1^3 = 1); (b = 2), (9 > 8); (b = 3), equal; (b = 4), (81 > 64); (b = 5), (243 > 125). So, yes, (3^b) is always greater than or equal to (b^3) for (b geq 1), with equality only when (b = 3).So, for (a = 3), (3^b geq b^3), with equality only at (b = 3).Similarly, for (a = 4), when does (4^b) overtake (b^4)?Let's compute:(b = 1): (4 > 1).(b = 2): (16 > 16). Equal.(b = 3): (64 > 81). Wait, 64 < 81. So (4^3 = 64 < 3^4 = 81).(b = 4): Equal.(b = 5): (1024 > 625).So, for (a = 4), (4^b) is greater than (b^4) when (b geq 5), equal when (b = 2, 4), and less when (b = 3).So, the point where (a^b) overtakes (b^a) is different for different (a).This might help in analyzing the equation.Given that, let's go back to the original equation: (a^{b} + a + b = b^{a}).We can rearrange it as:(a^{b} - b^{a} = - (a + b))So, (a^{b} - b^{a}) is negative, which implies (a^{b} < b^{a}).So, we need to find natural numbers (a, b) such that (a^{b} < b^{a}), and the difference (b^{a} - a^{b}) equals (a + b).So, (b^{a} - a^{b} = a + b).So, we need (b^{a} - a^{b}) to be equal to (a + b). Let's denote (D = b^{a} - a^{b}), so (D = a + b).We can think about this as (D) must be equal to (a + b). So, for given (a) and (b), compute (D) and see if it equals (a + b).But how can we find such pairs?Alternatively, maybe we can bound (D) in terms of (a) and (b).Let me think about the function (f(a, b) = b^{a} - a^{b}). We need (f(a, b) = a + b).We already saw that for (a = 5), (b = 2), (f(5, 2) = 32 - 25 = 7), which is equal to (5 + 2 = 7). So that works.Let me see if there are other such pairs.Wait, let's try (a = 2), (b = 4):(f(2, 4) = 16 - 16 = 0), which is not equal to (2 + 4 = 6).(a = 2), (b = 5):(f(2, 5) = 32 - 25 = 7), which is equal to (2 + 5 = 7). Wait, that's the same as (a = 5), (b = 2). So, ((2, 5)) gives (f(2,5) = 7), which is equal to (2 + 5 = 7). But earlier, when I plugged into the original equation, it didn't satisfy because (2^5 + 2 + 5 = 32 + 2 + 5 = 39), which is not equal to (5^2 = 25). Wait, that's confusing.Wait, hold on. If (f(a, b) = b^{a} - a^{b} = a + b), then for (a = 2), (b = 5), (f(2,5) = 32 - 25 = 7 = 2 + 5 = 7). So, according to this, (f(a, b) = a + b). But in the original equation, (a^{b} + a + b = b^{a}), which is equivalent to (b^{a} - a^{b} = a + b). So, yes, if (f(a, b) = a + b), then the original equation is satisfied.But when I plug (a = 2), (b = 5) into the original equation, I get:Left side: (2^{5} + 2 + 5 = 32 + 2 + 5 = 39)Right side: (5^{2} = 25)39 ‚â† 25. So, that's a contradiction.Wait, so what's the issue here? If (f(a, b) = b^{a} - a^{b} = a + b), then (b^{a} - a^{b} = a + b), so (a^{b} + a + b = b^{a}). So, that should hold.But when I plug (a = 2), (b = 5), I get 39 ‚â† 25. So, that suggests that my reasoning is flawed.Wait, no, actually, if (f(a, b) = b^{a} - a^{b} = a + b), then (b^{a} = a^{b} + a + b), which is exactly the original equation. So, if (f(a, b) = a + b), then the equation is satisfied.But when I plug (a = 2), (b = 5), (f(a, b) = 32 - 25 = 7), which is equal to (2 + 5 = 7). So, according to this, the equation should hold. But when I compute (2^{5} + 2 + 5 = 32 + 2 + 5 = 39), which is not equal to (5^{2} = 25). So, something is wrong here.Wait, hold on, (f(a, b) = b^{a} - a^{b}). So, for (a = 2), (b = 5), (f(2,5) = 5^{2} - 2^{5} = 25 - 32 = -7). Wait, that's negative. So, (f(a, b) = -7), which is not equal to (2 + 5 = 7).Wait, so I think I made a mistake earlier. The function (f(a, b)) is (b^{a} - a^{b}), which for (a = 2), (b = 5) is (25 - 32 = -7), not 7. So, my previous calculation was wrong.So, in fact, (f(a, b) = b^{a} - a^{b}). So, for (a = 5), (b = 2), (f(5,2) = 2^{5} - 5^{2} = 32 - 25 = 7), which equals (5 + 2 = 7). So, that works.But for (a = 2), (b = 5), (f(2,5) = 5^{2} - 2^{5} = 25 - 32 = -7), which is not equal to (2 + 5 = 7). So, that doesn't work.Therefore, only ((5, 2)) works, not ((2, 5)).So, my mistake earlier was thinking that (f(a, b)) is always positive, but it can be negative depending on (a) and (b).So, in order for (f(a, b) = a + b), we need (b^{a} - a^{b} = a + b). So, (b^{a}) must be greater than (a^{b}), and the difference is exactly (a + b).So, for (a = 5), (b = 2), we have (2^{5} = 32), (5^{2} = 25), so (32 - 25 = 7 = 5 + 2). Perfect.Are there any other pairs where (b^{a} - a^{b} = a + b)?Let me check (a = 3), (b = 2):(f(3,2) = 2^{3} - 3^{2} = 8 - 9 = -1), which is not equal to (3 + 2 = 5).(a = 4), (b = 2):(f(4,2) = 2^{4} - 4^{2} = 16 - 16 = 0), not equal to (4 + 2 = 6).(a = 3), (b = 4):(f(3,4) = 4^{3} - 3^{4} = 64 - 81 = -17), not equal to (3 + 4 = 7).(a = 4), (b = 3):(f(4,3) = 3^{4} - 4^{3} = 81 - 64 = 17), which is not equal to (4 + 3 = 7).(a = 4), (b = 5):(f(4,5) = 5^{4} - 4^{5} = 625 - 1024 = -399), not equal to (4 + 5 = 9).(a = 5), (b = 3):(f(5,3) = 3^{5} - 5^{3} = 243 - 125 = 118), not equal to (5 + 3 = 8).(a = 3), (b = 5):(f(3,5) = 5^{3} - 3^{5} = 125 - 243 = -118), not equal to (3 + 5 = 8).(a = 5), (b = 4):(f(5,4) = 4^{5} - 5^{4} = 1024 - 625 = 399), not equal to (5 + 4 = 9).(a = 4), (b = 6):(f(4,6) = 6^{4} - 4^{6} = 1296 - 4096 = -2800), not equal to (4 + 6 = 10).(a = 6), (b = 4):(f(6,4) = 4^{6} - 6^{4} = 4096 - 1296 = 2800), not equal to (6 + 4 = 10).Hmm, seems like the difference is either too big or negative.Wait, let's try (a = 2), (b = 4):(f(2,4) = 4^{2} - 2^{4} = 16 - 16 = 0), not equal to (2 + 4 = 6).(a = 2), (b = 3):(f(2,3) = 3^{2} - 2^{3} = 9 - 8 = 1), not equal to (2 + 3 = 5).(a = 3), (b = 2):(f(3,2) = 2^{3} - 3^{2} = 8 - 9 = -1), not equal to (3 + 2 = 5).(a = 2), (b = 6):(f(2,6) = 6^{2} - 2^{6} = 36 - 64 = -28), not equal to (2 + 6 = 8).(a = 6), (b = 2):(f(6,2) = 2^{6} - 6^{2} = 64 - 36 = 28), not equal to (6 + 2 = 8).Wait, 28 ‚â† 8, so that's not a solution.What about (a = 2), (b = 7):(f(2,7) = 7^{2} - 2^{7} = 49 - 128 = -79), not equal to (2 + 7 = 9).(a = 7), (b = 2):(f(7,2) = 2^{7} - 7^{2} = 128 - 49 = 79), not equal to (7 + 2 = 9).Hmm, 79 ‚â† 9.So, seems like only ((5, 2)) satisfies (f(a, b) = a + b).Wait, let me check (a = 2), (b = 1):(f(2,1) = 1^{2} - 2^{1} = 1 - 2 = -1), not equal to (2 + 1 = 3).(a = 1), (b = 2):(f(1,2) = 2^{1} - 1^{2} = 2 - 1 = 1), not equal to (1 + 2 = 3).(a = 2), (b = 2):(f(2,2) = 2^{2} - 2^{2} = 0), not equal to (2 + 2 = 4).(a = 2), (b = 8):(f(2,8) = 8^{2} - 2^{8} = 64 - 256 = -192), not equal to (2 + 8 = 10).(a = 8), (b = 2):(f(8,2) = 2^{8} - 8^{2} = 256 - 64 = 192), not equal to (8 + 2 = 10).So, 192 ‚â† 10.Wait, so maybe ((5, 2)) is the only solution.But let me check higher (a) and (b). Maybe (a = 6), (b = 3):(f(6,3) = 3^{6} - 6^{3} = 729 - 216 = 513), which is not equal to (6 + 3 = 9).(a = 3), (b = 6):(f(3,6) = 6^{3} - 3^{6} = 216 - 729 = -513), not equal to (3 + 6 = 9).(a = 4), (b = 5):(f(4,5) = 5^{4} - 4^{5} = 625 - 1024 = -399), not equal to (4 + 5 = 9).(a = 5), (b = 4):(f(5,4) = 4^{5} - 5^{4} = 1024 - 625 = 399), not equal to (5 + 4 = 9).Hmm, 399 ‚â† 9.Wait, maybe (a = 2), (b = 9):(f(2,9) = 9^{2} - 2^{9} = 81 - 512 = -431), not equal to (2 + 9 = 11).(a = 9), (b = 2):(f(9,2) = 2^{9} - 9^{2} = 512 - 81 = 431), not equal to (9 + 2 = 11).So, 431 ‚â† 11.Wait, seems like as (a) and (b) increase, the difference (f(a, b)) becomes either very large positive or negative, but not equal to (a + b).So, maybe ((5, 2)) is the only solution.But let me check (a = 2), (b = 10):(f(2,10) = 10^{2} - 2^{10} = 100 - 1024 = -924), not equal to (2 + 10 = 12).(a = 10), (b = 2):(f(10,2) = 2^{10} - 10^{2} = 1024 - 100 = 924), not equal to (10 + 2 = 12).924 ‚â† 12.So, yeah, it's not equal.Wait, let me think differently. Maybe I can bound (a) and (b) somehow.Suppose (a geq 6) and (b geq 3). Then (a^{b}) is going to be significantly larger than (b^{a}) or vice versa, depending on the relation between (a) and (b).Wait, for example, if (a > b), then (a^{b}) might be less than (b^{a}) if (a) is not too large. Wait, no, actually, for fixed (a > b), as (a) increases, (a^{b}) grows polynomially, while (b^{a}) grows exponentially. So, for large (a), (b^{a}) will dominate.Wait, but in our case, we have (a^{b} + a + b = b^{a}). So, if (a) is large and (b) is fixed, (a^{b}) is polynomial in (a), while (b^{a}) is exponential in (a). So, for large (a), (b^{a}) will dominate, making the equation hold only if (a^{b}) is approximately equal to (b^{a}), but with the addition of (a + b). Hmm, not sure.Alternatively, maybe we can consider the ratio (frac{a^{b}}{b^{a}}). Let's denote (R = frac{a^{b}}{b^{a}}). Then, the equation becomes:(R cdot b^{a} + a + b = b^{a})So,(R cdot b^{a} + a + b = b^{a})Which can be rewritten as:((R - 1) cdot b^{a} + a + b = 0)But since (R = frac{a^{b}}{b^{a}}), which is positive, but depending on whether (a^{b}) is greater or less than (b^{a}), (R) can be greater or less than 1.But in our case, since (a^{b} + a + b = b^{a}), we have (a^{b} < b^{a}), so (R < 1).So, ((R - 1) cdot b^{a} + a + b = 0)Which is:((R - 1) cdot b^{a} = - (a + b))So,((1 - R) cdot b^{a} = a + b)Since (1 - R > 0), because (R < 1).So,(b^{a} cdot (1 - R) = a + b)But (1 - R = 1 - frac{a^{b}}{b^{a}} = frac{b^{a} - a^{b}}{b^{a}})So,(b^{a} cdot frac{b^{a} - a^{b}}{b^{a}} = a + b)Simplify:(b^{a} - a^{b} = a + b)Which is the same as before.So, not much progress.Alternatively, maybe I can take logarithms.Take natural logarithm on both sides of (a^{b} + a + b = b^{a}). Hmm, but that might complicate things because of the addition.Alternatively, for (a) and (b) greater than or equal to 2, maybe I can bound (a^{b}) and (b^{a}).Wait, let's consider the function (f(x) = frac{ln x}{x}). This function is increasing on ((0, e)) and decreasing on ((e, infty)). So, for (x > e), the function decreases.So, if (a > b > e), then (frac{ln a}{a} < frac{ln b}{b}), which implies (a^{b} < b^{a}).Similarly, if (b > a > e), then (a^{b} > b^{a}).But in our case, we have (a^{b} < b^{a}), so either (a > b > e) or (b > a > e) with (a^{b} < b^{a}).But since (e approx 2.718), so for (a, b geq 3), the function (f(x)) is decreasing.So, if (a > b geq 3), then (a^{b} < b^{a}).Similarly, if (b > a geq 3), then (a^{b} > b^{a}).So, in our case, since (a^{b} < b^{a}), we must have (a > b geq 3).Wait, but if (a > b geq 3), then (a^{b} < b^{a}). So, in that case, (a^{b} + a + b = b^{a}) is possible.But let's see, for (a > b geq 3), how big is (a^{b} + a + b) compared to (b^{a}).For example, take (a = 4), (b = 3):(4^{3} + 4 + 3 = 64 + 4 + 3 = 71)(3^{4} = 81)71 < 81, so (71 ‚â† 81).Similarly, (a = 5), (b = 3):(5^{3} + 5 + 3 = 125 + 5 + 3 = 133)(3^{5} = 243)133 < 243.(a = 5), (b = 4):(5^{4} + 5 + 4 = 625 + 5 + 4 = 634)(4^{5} = 1024)634 < 1024.(a = 6), (b = 3):(6^{3} + 6 + 3 = 216 + 6 + 3 = 225)(3^{6} = 729)225 < 729.(a = 6), (b = 4):(6^{4} + 6 + 4 = 1296 + 6 + 4 = 1306)(4^{6} = 4096)1306 < 4096.So, in all these cases, (a^{b} + a + b < b^{a}). So, maybe for (a > b geq 3), the left side is less than the right side.But wait, earlier when (a = 5), (b = 2), which is (a > b) but (b = 2 < 3), we had a solution.So, perhaps the only solution is when (a > b) and (b = 2).Let me test that.Let me fix (b = 2) and vary (a).Equation becomes:(a^{2} + a + 2 = 2^{a})We need to find natural numbers (a) such that (a^{2} + a + 2 = 2^{a}).Let's compute this for (a = 1):Left: (1 + 1 + 2 = 4)Right: (2)4 ‚â† 2.(a = 2):Left: (4 + 2 + 2 = 8)Right: (4)8 ‚â† 4.(a = 3):Left: (9 + 3 + 2 = 14)Right: (8)14 ‚â† 8.(a = 4):Left: (16 + 4 + 2 = 22)Right: (16)22 ‚â† 16.(a = 5):Left: (25 + 5 + 2 = 32)Right: (32)32 = 32. So, (a = 5), (b = 2) is a solution.(a = 6):Left: (36 + 6 + 2 = 44)Right: (64)44 ‚â† 64.(a = 7):Left: (49 + 7 + 2 = 58)Right: (128)58 ‚â† 128.(a = 8):Left: (64 + 8 + 2 = 74)Right: (256)74 ‚â† 256.(a = 9):Left: (81 + 9 + 2 = 92)Right: (512)92 ‚â† 512.So, only (a = 5) works when (b = 2).Similarly, let's fix (b = 1):Equation becomes:(a^{1} + a + 1 = 1^{a})Simplify:(a + a + 1 = 1)Which is:(2a + 1 = 1)So, (2a = 0), which implies (a = 0), but (a) must be natural, so no solution.Similarly, for (b = 2), we have only (a = 5) as a solution.What about (b = 3):Equation: (a^{3} + a + 3 = 3^{a})Let me compute for (a = 1):Left: (1 + 1 + 3 = 5)Right: (3)5 ‚â† 3.(a = 2):Left: (8 + 2 + 3 = 13)Right: (9)13 ‚â† 9.(a = 3):Left: (27 + 3 + 3 = 33)Right: (27)33 ‚â† 27.(a = 4):Left: (64 + 4 + 3 = 71)Right: (81)71 ‚â† 81.(a = 5):Left: (125 + 5 + 3 = 133)Right: (243)133 ‚â† 243.(a = 6):Left: (216 + 6 + 3 = 225)Right: (729)225 ‚â† 729.So, no solution for (b = 3).Similarly, (b = 4):Equation: (a^{4} + a + 4 = 4^{a})Testing (a = 1):Left: (1 + 1 + 4 = 6)Right: (4)6 ‚â† 4.(a = 2):Left: (16 + 2 + 4 = 22)Right: (16)22 ‚â† 16.(a = 3):Left: (81 + 3 + 4 = 88)Right: (64)88 ‚â† 64.(a = 4):Left: (256 + 4 + 4 = 264)Right: (256)264 ‚â† 256.(a = 5):Left: (625 + 5 + 4 = 634)Right: (1024)634 ‚â† 1024.(a = 6):Left: (1296 + 6 + 4 = 1306)Right: (4096)1306 ‚â† 4096.So, no solution for (b = 4).Similarly, (b = 5):Equation: (a^{5} + a + 5 = 5^{a})Testing (a = 1):Left: (1 + 1 + 5 = 7)Right: (5)7 ‚â† 5.(a = 2):Left: (32 + 2 + 5 = 39)Right: (25)39 ‚â† 25.(a = 3):Left: (243 + 3 + 5 = 251)Right: (125)251 ‚â† 125.(a = 4):Left: (1024 + 4 + 5 = 1033)Right: (625)1033 ‚â† 625.(a = 5):Left: (3125 + 5 + 5 = 3135)Right: (3125)3135 ‚â† 3125.(a = 6):Left: (7776 + 6 + 5 = 7787)Right: (15625)7787 ‚â† 15625.So, no solution for (b = 5).Similarly, (b = 6):Equation: (a^{6} + a + 6 = 6^{a})Testing (a = 1):Left: (1 + 1 + 6 = 8)Right: (6)8 ‚â† 6.(a = 2):Left: (64 + 2 + 6 = 72)Right: (36)72 ‚â† 36.(a = 3):Left: (729 + 3 + 6 = 738)Right: (216)738 ‚â† 216.(a = 4):Left: (4096 + 4 + 6 = 4106)Right: (1296)4106 ‚â† 1296.(a = 5):Left: (15625 + 5 + 6 = 15636)Right: (7776)15636 ‚â† 7776.(a = 6):Left: (46656 + 6 + 6 = 46668)Right: (46656)46668 ‚â† 46656.So, no solution for (b = 6).It seems like as (b) increases, the right side (b^{a}) grows much faster than the left side (a^{b} + a + b), making it unlikely for the equation to hold.Therefore, after testing various values and considering the behavior of the functions involved, it appears that the only solution in natural numbers is ((a, b) = (5, 2)).**Final Answer**The only solution in natural numbers is boxed{(5, 2)}."},{"question":"When (a=3), what is the output of the following program?\`\`\`If a < 10 Then    y=2*aElse    y=a*aPrint y\`\`\`","answer":"First, I need to determine the value of ( y ) based on the given program and the value ( a = 3 ).The program checks if ( a ) is less than 10.

Point P lies on line segment AB, such that overrightarrow{AP}=t cdot overrightarrow{AB} for 0 leqslant t leqslant 1. What is the maximum value of overrightarrow{OA} cdot overrightarrow{OP}?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where point O is the origin, and points A and B are at (a, 0) and (0, a) respectively. Point P is somewhere on the line segment AB, and it's defined by the vector equation AP = t * AB, where t is between 0 and 1. I need to find the maximum value of the dot product OA ¬∑ OP.First, let me try to visualize this. Points A and B are on the x-axis and y-axis respectively, each at a distance 'a' from the origin. The line segment AB connects these two points, forming a diagonal. Point P moves along this diagonal from A to B as t increases from 0 to 1.The vector OA is straightforward since it's just the vector from the origin to point A, which is (a, 0). Similarly, OP is the vector from the origin to point P, which we need to express in terms of t.Given that AP = t * AB, I should figure out the coordinates of point P. Let's break this down. The vector AB is from A to B, so AB = B - A = (0, a) - (a, 0) = (-a, a). Therefore, AP = t * AB = t*(-a, a) = (-a*t, a*t).Since AP is the vector from A to P, we can find the coordinates of P by adding vector AP to point A. So, P = A + AP = (a, 0) + (-a*t, a*t) = (a - a*t, 0 + a*t) = (a(1 - t), a*t).So, the coordinates of P are (a(1 - t), a*t). Therefore, the vector OP is (a(1 - t), a*t).Now, the dot product OA ¬∑ OP is the dot product of vectors OA and OP. OA is (a, 0) and OP is (a(1 - t), a*t). The dot product is calculated as:OA ¬∑ OP = (a)*(a(1 - t)) + (0)*(a*t) = a^2(1 - t) + 0 = a^2(1 - t).Wait, that seems too simple. So, the dot product is a^2(1 - t). Since t ranges from 0 to 1, the expression 1 - t will range from 1 to 0. Therefore, the maximum value of OA ¬∑ OP occurs when t is 0, giving a^2(1 - 0) = a^2.But hold on, is that correct? Let me verify. If t = 0, then point P is at point A, so OP is OA, and the dot product OA ¬∑ OA is |OA|^2, which is a^2. That makes sense.But wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the coordinates of P. Let me double-check. Vector AB is (-a, a), so AP = t*(-a, a) = (-a*t, a*t). Then, adding AP to A: (a, 0) + (-a*t, a*t) = (a - a*t, 0 + a*t). So, yes, that's correct.Alternatively, maybe I should parameterize point P differently. Let me think. Another way to represent point P moving from A to B is using the parametric equations of the line AB.The parametric equations can be written as:x = a - a*ty = 0 + a*tWhich is the same as what I found earlier. So, OP is (a(1 - t), a*t). So, OA ¬∑ OP is indeed a^2(1 - t).Since t is between 0 and 1, 1 - t is between 0 and 1, so the maximum occurs at t = 0, giving OA ¬∑ OP = a^2.But wait, is there another way to interpret the vector equation? Maybe I should consider the vector OP in terms of position vectors.Alternatively, perhaps I should express OP as a linear combination of OA and OB. Since P is on AB, we can write OP = OA + t*(OB - OA). Let's compute that.OB is (0, a), so OB - OA = (-a, a). Then, OP = OA + t*(OB - OA) = (a, 0) + t*(-a, a) = (a - a*t, 0 + a*t), which is the same as before.So, OP is indeed (a(1 - t), a*t). Therefore, OA ¬∑ OP is a^2(1 - t). So, it's a linear function in terms of t, decreasing from a^2 to 0 as t goes from 0 to 1.Therefore, the maximum value is a^2 when t = 0.But wait, maybe I should consider if the dot product can be larger somewhere else. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating the dot product.Let me compute OA ¬∑ OP again. OA is (a, 0), OP is (a(1 - t), a*t). The dot product is a*(a(1 - t)) + 0*(a*t) = a^2(1 - t) + 0 = a^2(1 - t). So, yes, that's correct.Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of projections. The dot product OA ¬∑ OP is equal to |OA||OP|cos(theta), where theta is the angle between OA and OP.Since OA is along the x-axis, OP is a vector in the plane, so the angle theta is the angle between OP and the x-axis. The projection of OP onto OA is |OP|cos(theta), which is exactly the x-component of OP, which is a(1 - t). Therefore, OA ¬∑ OP = |OA|*(a(1 - t)) = a*(a(1 - t)) = a^2(1 - t). So, same result.Therefore, the maximum occurs when a(1 - t) is maximum, which is when t is minimum, i.e., t = 0. So, the maximum value is a^2.Wait, but let me think again. Maybe I should express OP in terms of vectors OA and OB and then compute the dot product.Let me denote OA as vector **a** = (a, 0) and OB as vector **b** = (0, a). Then, point P can be expressed as **a** + t(**b** - **a**) = (1 - t)**a** + t**b**.Therefore, OP = (1 - t)**a** + t**b**.Then, OA ¬∑ OP = OA ¬∑ [(1 - t)OA + t OB] = (1 - t)(OA ¬∑ OA) + t(OA ¬∑ OB).Since OA ¬∑ OA is |OA|^2 = a^2, and OA ¬∑ OB is (a, 0)¬∑(0, a) = 0.Therefore, OA ¬∑ OP = (1 - t)a^2 + t*0 = a^2(1 - t).Same result again. So, the maximum is a^2 when t = 0.Hmm, so all methods lead me to the conclusion that the maximum value is a^2.But wait, maybe I should consider calculus. Let me treat OA ¬∑ OP as a function of t and find its maximum.Let f(t) = OA ¬∑ OP = a^2(1 - t). Then, df/dt = -a^2. Since the derivative is constant and negative, the function is decreasing in t. Therefore, the maximum occurs at the smallest t, which is t = 0, giving f(0) = a^2.Therefore, the maximum value is a^2.But wait, just to make sure, let me think about the geometric interpretation. The dot product OA ¬∑ OP is the product of the magnitudes of OA and OP times the cosine of the angle between them. Since OA is fixed, to maximize the dot product, we need to maximize the projection of OP onto OA, which is the x-component of OP.Since OP moves from OA to OB as P moves from A to B, the x-component of OP decreases from a to 0. Therefore, the maximum x-component is a, which occurs when P is at A, i.e., t = 0.Therefore, the maximum value of OA ¬∑ OP is a^2.Wait, but let me think again. Maybe I should consider the vector OP in terms of t and compute the dot product differently.Alternatively, perhaps I can express OP in terms of coordinates and compute the dot product.Wait, I already did that. OP is (a(1 - t), a*t), OA is (a, 0). So, OA ¬∑ OP = a*(a(1 - t)) + 0*(a*t) = a^2(1 - t). So, yeah, that's correct.Alternatively, maybe I can use Lagrange multipliers or something, but that seems overkill for this problem.Alternatively, maybe I can consider the parametric equation of OP and find its maximum.But since OP is moving along AB, and the dot product with OA is linear in t, it's straightforward.So, I think I've confirmed it multiple ways. The maximum value is a^2.But wait, just to make sure, let me plug in t = 0 and t = 1.At t = 0, P is at A, so OP is OA, so OA ¬∑ OP = OA ¬∑ OA = a^2.At t = 1, P is at B, so OP is OB, which is (0, a). Then, OA ¬∑ OP = (a, 0)¬∑(0, a) = 0.So, yes, the dot product decreases from a^2 to 0 as t increases from 0 to 1.Therefore, the maximum value is indeed a^2.Wait, but hold on. Maybe I should consider the possibility that the maximum occurs somewhere else if the function is not linear. But in this case, since the dot product is linear in t, it's a straight line, so the maximum must be at one of the endpoints.Therefore, the maximum is a^2.So, after all these considerations, I think the maximum value is a squared.**Final Answer**The maximum value of overrightarrow{OA} cdot overrightarrow{OP} is boxed{a^2}."},{"question":"Determine the volume of the square truncated pyramid if its height is 6, the side of the lower base is 4, and the side of the upper base is 2.","answer":"Okay, so I need to find the volume of a square truncated pyramid. Hmm, let me think. I remember that a truncated pyramid is like a pyramid with the top cut off, so it has two square bases, one larger and one smaller. The problem gives me the height, which is 6 units, the side of the lower base is 4 units, and the side of the upper base is 2 units. First, I should recall the formula for the volume of a truncated pyramid, also known as a frustum. I think it's something like the average of the areas of the two bases multiplied by the height, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to remember. I think the formula is:Volume = (1/3) * height * (Area of lower base + Area of upper base + sqrt(Area of lower base * Area of upper base))Wait, is that right? Or is it just the average of the two bases times the height? Hmm, no, I think it's more complicated than that because it's a three-dimensional shape. Maybe it's similar to the formula for the volume of a pyramid, which is (1/3)*base area*height, but adjusted for the top part that's been cut off.Let me check my notes or maybe visualize it. If I have a full pyramid and then I cut off the top, the volume of the frustum would be the volume of the original pyramid minus the volume of the smaller pyramid that was cut off. So, maybe I can approach it that way.Let me denote the height of the original pyramid as H, and the height of the smaller pyramid as h. Then, the height of the frustum would be H - h = 6. The side lengths of the bases are 4 and 2, so the original base is 4x4 and the top base is 2x2. Since the pyramids are similar, the ratio of their corresponding sides is 2/4 = 1/2. That means the height of the smaller pyramid is half the height of the original pyramid. So, h = H/2.But we know that H - h = 6. Substituting h = H/2, we get H - H/2 = 6, which simplifies to H/2 = 6, so H = 12. Therefore, the height of the original pyramid is 12 units, and the height of the smaller pyramid is 6 units.Now, the volume of the original pyramid is (1/3)*base area*height = (1/3)*(4^2)*12. Let's compute that: 4^2 is 16, 16*12 is 192, and 192*(1/3) is 64. So, the volume of the original pyramid is 64 cubic units.The volume of the smaller pyramid is (1/3)*(2^2)*6. Let's calculate that: 2^2 is 4, 4*6 is 24, and 24*(1/3) is 8. So, the volume of the smaller pyramid is 8 cubic units.Therefore, the volume of the frustum is the difference between the two: 64 - 8 = 56 cubic units.Wait, but earlier I thought the formula was (1/3)*height*(A1 + A2 + sqrt(A1*A2)). Let me check if that gives the same result. The areas A1 and A2 are 16 and 4, respectively. So, plugging into the formula:Volume = (1/3)*6*(16 + 4 + sqrt(16*4)) = (1/3)*6*(20 + sqrt(64)) = (1/3)*6*(20 + 8) = (1/3)*6*28 = 2*28 = 56.Yes, that's the same result. So, both methods give me 56. Therefore, the volume is 56 cubic units.But just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let me go through the steps again. The original pyramid has a height of 12, base area 16, so volume 64. The smaller pyramid has height 6, base area 4, so volume 8. Subtracting, 64 - 8 = 56. Alternatively, using the frustum formula: (1/3)*6*(16 + 4 + 8) = (1/3)*6*28 = 56. Yep, that seems consistent.I think that's solid. So, the volume is 56.**Final Answer**The volume of the square truncated pyramid is boxed{56}."},{"question":"Create an equation of a circle with its center at the origin and radius r.","answer":"To create the equation of a circle centered at the origin with radius ( r ), I start by recalling the general form of a circle's equation.

Determine the total number of people admitted for Influenza A (H1N1) over 30 days.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the total number of people admitted to a hospital over 30 days due to Influenza A (H1N1). The number of admissions each day forms a sequence {a_n}, and I know the first two terms: a‚ÇÅ = 1 and a‚ÇÇ = 2. There's also a recurrence relation given: a_{n+2} - a_n = 1 + (-1)^n. Hmm, that seems a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down.First, let me write down what I know:- a‚ÇÅ = 1- a‚ÇÇ = 2- For n ‚â• 1, a_{n+2} - a_n = 1 + (-1)^nI need to find the sum S = a‚ÇÅ + a‚ÇÇ + a‚ÇÉ + ... + a_{30}.Since the recurrence relation involves a_{n+2} and a_n, it's a second-order linear recurrence. Maybe I can find a pattern or a closed-form expression for a_n.Let me try to compute the first few terms to see if I can spot a pattern.Given:- a‚ÇÅ = 1- a‚ÇÇ = 2Let's compute a‚ÇÉ:Using n = 1 in the recurrence:a_{1+2} - a‚ÇÅ = 1 + (-1)^1a‚ÇÉ - a‚ÇÅ = 1 - 1 = 0So, a‚ÇÉ = a‚ÇÅ = 1Now, a‚ÇÑ:Using n = 2:a_{2+2} - a‚ÇÇ = 1 + (-1)^2a‚ÇÑ - a‚ÇÇ = 1 + 1 = 2So, a‚ÇÑ = a‚ÇÇ + 2 = 2 + 2 = 4Next, a‚ÇÖ:Using n = 3:a_{3+2} - a‚ÇÉ = 1 + (-1)^3a‚ÇÖ - a‚ÇÉ = 1 - 1 = 0Thus, a‚ÇÖ = a‚ÇÉ = 1a‚ÇÜ:n = 4:a_{4+2} - a‚ÇÑ = 1 + (-1)^4a‚ÇÜ - a‚ÇÑ = 1 + 1 = 2So, a‚ÇÜ = a‚ÇÑ + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6a‚Çá:n = 5:a_{5+2} - a‚ÇÖ = 1 + (-1)^5a‚Çá - a‚ÇÖ = 1 - 1 = 0Thus, a‚Çá = a‚ÇÖ = 1a‚Çà:n = 6:a_{6+2} - a‚ÇÜ = 1 + (-1)^6a‚Çà - a‚ÇÜ = 1 + 1 = 2So, a‚Çà = a‚ÇÜ + 2 = 6 + 2 = 8Hmm, I'm noticing a pattern here. Let me list out the terms I have so far:n : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8a_n:1 2 1 4 1 6 1 8So, it seems like for odd n, a_n = 1, and for even n, a_n increases by 2 each time. Let me verify this with the recurrence.For odd n: Let's say n is odd, so n = 2k - 1 for some integer k. Then, a_{n+2} - a_n = 1 + (-1)^n. Since n is odd, (-1)^n = -1. So, a_{n+2} - a_n = 1 - 1 = 0. Therefore, a_{n+2} = a_n. So, if a_n is 1, then a_{n+2} is also 1. That explains why all odd terms are 1.For even n: Let n be even, so n = 2k. Then, a_{n+2} - a_n = 1 + (-1)^n. Since n is even, (-1)^n = 1. So, a_{n+2} = a_n + 2. That means each even term is 2 more than the previous even term. So starting from a‚ÇÇ = 2, a‚ÇÑ = 4, a‚ÇÜ = 6, a‚Çà = 8, and so on. So, the even terms form an arithmetic sequence starting at 2 with a common difference of 2.Therefore, the general form of the sequence is:- If n is odd, a_n = 1- If n is even, a_n = 2*(n/2) = nWait, let me check that. For n even, a_n = n. Let's see:n=2: 2, which is correctn=4: 4, correctn=6: 6, correctn=8: 8, correctYes, that seems to hold. So, for even n, a_n = n, and for odd n, a_n = 1.So, now, to find the total number of people admitted over 30 days, I need to compute the sum S = a‚ÇÅ + a‚ÇÇ + a‚ÇÉ + ... + a_{30}.Since 30 is even, we can split the sum into two parts: the sum of the odd-indexed terms and the sum of the even-indexed terms.Number of odd days: 15 (days 1,3,5,...,29)Number of even days: 15 (days 2,4,6,...,30)Sum of odd-indexed terms: Each odd term is 1, so sum = 15*1 = 15Sum of even-indexed terms: Each even term is equal to the day number, so sum = 2 + 4 + 6 + ... + 30This is an arithmetic series where first term a = 2, last term l = 30, number of terms = 15.Sum = (number of terms)/2 * (a + l) = (15/2)*(2 + 30) = (15/2)*32 = 15*16 = 240Therefore, total sum S = 15 + 240 = 255Wait, let me double-check that. The sum of the first 15 even numbers starting from 2 is indeed 2 + 4 + ... + 30. The formula for the sum of the first n even numbers is n*(n + 1). So, for n=15, sum = 15*16 = 240. That's correct.And the sum of the odd-indexed terms is 15*1=15. So, total is 240 + 15 = 255.But just to be thorough, let me compute the sum step by step for the first few terms to ensure my pattern holds.Compute S for n=1: 1n=2: 1+2=3n=3: 1+2+1=4n=4: 1+2+1+4=8n=5: 1+2+1+4+1=9n=6: 1+2+1+4+1+6=15n=7: 1+2+1+4+1+6+1=16n=8: 1+2+1+4+1+6+1+8=24Wait, let's see if this aligns with my earlier conclusion.For n=8, the sum is 24. According to my formula, sum of first 4 even terms: 2+4+6+8=20, and sum of first 4 odd terms:1+1+1+1=4, total 24. Correct.Similarly, for n=6: sum of first 3 even terms:2+4+6=12, sum of first 3 odd terms:1+1+1=3, total 15. Correct.So, my formula seems consistent.Thus, for n=30, the sum is 255.But just to make sure, let me compute the sum another way.Since the sequence alternates between 1 and increasing even numbers, the total sum is 15*1 + sum of first 15 even numbers.Sum of first n even numbers is n(n + 1). So, for n=15, it's 15*16=240. Then, 15*1=15, so total 255.Yes, that's correct.Alternatively, I can think of the sequence as:a_n = 1 if n is odd,a_n = n if n is even.Therefore, the sum S = sum_{k=1}^{30} a_k = sum_{odd k=1}^{29} 1 + sum_{even k=2}^{30} kNumber of odd terms: 15, each contributing 1: 15Sum of even terms: 2 + 4 + 6 + ... + 30 = 2*(1 + 2 + 3 + ... +15) = 2*(15*16)/2 = 15*16=240Therefore, total sum S = 15 + 240 = 255So, I'm confident that the total number of people admitted over 30 days is 255.**Final Answer**The total number of people admitted over 30 days is boxed{255}."},{"question":"Given that k and n are non-negative real numbers, and 2k+n=2, find the minimum value of 2k^{2}-4n.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: given that k and n are non-negative real numbers, and 2k + n = 2, I need to find the minimum value of 2k¬≤ - 4n. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, I know that since 2k + n = 2, I can express one variable in terms of the other. Maybe I can solve for n in terms of k or vice versa. Let me try solving for n because it seems simpler. So, from the equation 2k + n = 2, subtracting 2k from both sides gives me n = 2 - 2k. Okay, so n is expressed in terms of k.Now, since n is non-negative, that means 2 - 2k ‚â• 0. So, 2 - 2k ‚â• 0 implies that 2k ‚â§ 2, which simplifies to k ‚â§ 1. Also, since k is non-negative, k must be between 0 and 1, inclusive. So, k ‚àà [0, 1].Similarly, since n is non-negative, and n = 2 - 2k, that also tells me that k can't be more than 1, which we already have. So, our domain for k is from 0 to 1.Now, the function we need to minimize is 2k¬≤ - 4n. But since we've expressed n in terms of k, we can substitute that into the function. So, replacing n with 2 - 2k, we get:2k¬≤ - 4(2 - 2k) = 2k¬≤ - 8 + 8k.Simplify that: 2k¬≤ + 8k - 8.So, now the problem reduces to finding the minimum value of the quadratic function f(k) = 2k¬≤ + 8k - 8, where k is in the interval [0, 1].Quadratic functions have their extrema either at the vertex or at the endpoints of the interval. Since this is a parabola opening upwards (because the coefficient of k¬≤ is positive), the vertex will give the minimum value.The vertex of a parabola given by f(k) = ak¬≤ + bk + c is at k = -b/(2a). So, in this case, a = 2 and b = 8. Therefore, the vertex is at k = -8/(2*2) = -8/4 = -2.Wait, but k must be between 0 and 1. So, the vertex is at k = -2, which is outside our interval. That means the minimum must occur at one of the endpoints of the interval, either at k = 0 or k = 1.So, let's evaluate f(k) at k = 0 and k = 1.First, at k = 0:f(0) = 2*(0)^2 + 8*(0) - 8 = 0 + 0 - 8 = -8.Next, at k = 1:f(1) = 2*(1)^2 + 8*(1) - 8 = 2 + 8 - 8 = 2.So, f(0) = -8 and f(1) = 2. Since we're looking for the minimum value, -8 is smaller than 2. Therefore, the minimum value of the function is -8, occurring at k = 0.But wait, let me double-check if this makes sense. When k = 0, n = 2 - 2*0 = 2. So, plugging back into the original function: 2*(0)^2 - 4*(2) = 0 - 8 = -8. That checks out.Is there any possibility that the minimum could be somewhere else? Since the vertex is at k = -2, which is outside our domain, and the function is increasing on the interval [0, 1] because the parabola opens upwards, the function will be increasing from k = 0 to k = 1. So, the minimum is indeed at k = 0.Therefore, the minimum value of 2k¬≤ - 4n is -8.**Final Answer**The minimum value is boxed{-8}."},{"question":"What is average speed? A car travels from point A to point B at a speed of 40 km/h, and returns at a speed of 60 km/h. What is the average speed of the car?","answer":"First, I need to understand what average speed means. It's the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken.Let's assume the distance between points A and B is D kilometers. So, the total distance for the round trip is 2D.Next, I'll calculate the time taken for each part of the journey. Going from A to B at 40 km/h takes D/40 hours. Returning from B to A at 60 km/h takes D/60 hours.Adding these times together gives the total time: D/40 + D/60. To combine these, I'll find a common denominator, which is 120. This simplifies to (3D + 2D)/120 = 5D/120 = D/24 hours.Finally, I'll calculate the average speed by dividing the total distance by the total time: 2D divided by D/24. This simplifies to 2D * 24/D = 48 km/h."},{"question":"(x^{2} cdot log _{x} 27 cdot log _{9} x = x + 4).","answer":"Okay, so I've got this equation to solve: (x^{2} cdot log _{x} 27 cdot log _{9} x = x + 4). Hmm, that looks a bit intimidating at first glance, but let me try to break it down step by step. I remember that logarithms can sometimes be tricky, especially when they have different bases, but maybe I can convert them to a common base or use some logarithmic identities to simplify things.First, let me recall some logarithmic properties. I know that (log_b a = frac{ln a}{ln b}), which is the change of base formula. Maybe I can use that to rewrite the logs with the same base, which might make things easier to handle. Alternatively, I remember that (log_b a = frac{1}{log_a b}), which is another useful identity. Let me see if that can help here.Looking at the equation, I have two logarithms: (log_x 27) and (log_9 x). Maybe I can express both in terms of base 3, since 27 is 3 cubed and 9 is 3 squared. That might make things simpler because 3 is a common base here.Let me start by expressing 27 and 9 in terms of 3. So, 27 is (3^3) and 9 is (3^2). Therefore, I can rewrite the logarithms:1. (log_x 27 = log_x 3^3). Using the power rule of logarithms, which states that (log_b a^n = n log_b a), this becomes (3 log_x 3).2. Similarly, (log_9 x = log_{3^2} x). Again, using the power rule, this is (frac{1}{2} log_3 x).So now, substituting these back into the original equation, we have:(x^{2} cdot 3 log_x 3 cdot frac{1}{2} log_3 x = x + 4).Simplify the constants first: 3 multiplied by 1/2 is 3/2. So, the equation becomes:(x^{2} cdot frac{3}{2} log_x 3 cdot log_3 x = x + 4).Hmm, now I have (log_x 3) and (log_3 x). Wait a second, I remember that (log_b a cdot log_a b = 1). Is that correct? Let me verify. If I have (log_b a = frac{ln a}{ln b}) and (log_a b = frac{ln b}{ln a}), then multiplying them together gives (frac{ln a}{ln b} cdot frac{ln b}{ln a} = 1). Yes, that's right! So, (log_x 3 cdot log_3 x = 1).Wow, that's a useful identity. So, in my equation, the product (log_x 3 cdot log_3 x) is equal to 1. That simplifies things a lot. So, substituting that back in, the equation becomes:(x^{2} cdot frac{3}{2} cdot 1 = x + 4).Simplify that further: (x^{2} cdot frac{3}{2} = x + 4). Let me write that as:(frac{3}{2} x^{2} = x + 4).To make it easier to handle, I can multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:(3x^{2} = 2x + 8).Now, let's bring all terms to one side to form a quadratic equation:(3x^{2} - 2x - 8 = 0).Okay, so now I have a quadratic equation. I can try to factor it or use the quadratic formula. Let me see if it factors nicely. The quadratic is (3x^{2} - 2x - 8). I need two numbers that multiply to (3 times (-8) = -24) and add up to -2. Let me think: factors of -24 could be 4 and -6, because 4 * (-6) = -24 and 4 + (-6) = -2. Perfect!So, I can rewrite the middle term using these numbers:(3x^{2} + 4x - 6x - 8 = 0).Now, group the terms:((3x^{2} + 4x) + (-6x - 8) = 0).Factor out the greatest common factor from each group:(x(3x + 4) - 2(3x + 4) = 0).Now, factor out the common binomial factor (3x + 4):((3x + 4)(x - 2) = 0).So, the solutions are when each factor equals zero:1. (3x + 4 = 0) leads to (x = -frac{4}{3}).2. (x - 2 = 0) leads to (x = 2).But wait, I need to check if these solutions are valid in the original equation because logarithms are only defined for positive real numbers, and the base of a logarithm must also be positive and not equal to 1.Looking at (x = -frac{4}{3}), that's negative, which isn't allowed because the base of the logarithm (log_x 27) would be negative, which is undefined. So, (x = -frac{4}{3}) is not a valid solution.Now, checking (x = 2). Let me substitute back into the original equation to make sure it works:Original equation: (2^{2} cdot log _{2} 27 cdot log _{9} 2 = 2 + 4).Compute each part:1. (2^{2} = 4).2. (log_{2} 27). Since 27 is (3^3), this is (log_{2} 3^3 = 3 log_{2} 3).3. (log_{9} 2). Since 9 is (3^2), this is (log_{3^2} 2 = frac{1}{2} log_{3} 2).Putting it all together:(4 cdot 3 log_{2} 3 cdot frac{1}{2} log_{3} 2).Simplify constants: 4 * 3 * 1/2 = 4 * 3/2 = 4 * 1.5 = 6.So, we have 6 * (log_{2} 3 cdot log_{3} 2).Again, using the identity that (log_{a} b cdot log_{b} a = 1), so this becomes 6 * 1 = 6.On the right side of the equation, (2 + 4 = 6). So, both sides equal 6, which means (x = 2) is indeed a valid solution.Therefore, the only solution is (x = 2).**Final Answer**The solution is boxed{2}."},{"question":"The numbers (1, 2, 3, ldots, 7) are randomly divided into two non-empty subsets. What is the probability that the sum of the numbers in the two subsets is equal? If the probability is expressed as (frac{p}{q}) in its lowest terms, find (p + q).","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where the numbers 1 through 7 are randomly divided into two non-empty subsets. I need to find the probability that the sum of the numbers in each subset is equal. Then, express that probability as a reduced fraction p/q and find p + q. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.First, I need to understand the total number of ways to divide the numbers 1 to 7 into two non-empty subsets. Since each number can go into either subset A or subset B, there are 2^7 = 128 possible ways. But wait, that includes the cases where all numbers are in subset A or all are in subset B, which are not allowed because both subsets must be non-empty. So, subtracting those two cases, we have 128 - 2 = 126 possible ways. So, the total number of possible divisions is 126.But hold on, in these 126 cases, each division is counted twice because swapping subset A and subset B gives the same division. For example, if subset A has {1,2} and subset B has {3,4,5,6,7}, that's the same division as subset A having {3,4,5,6,7} and subset B having {1,2}. So, if I want to count the number of unique divisions, I should divide by 2. Therefore, the total number of unique divisions is 126 / 2 = 63. Hmm, but wait, is that necessary for calculating probability? Because when we talk about probability, each division is equally likely, but whether we count them as unique or not depends on how we define the sample space.Wait, actually, in probability terms, each possible assignment is equally likely, so each of the 126 cases is equally probable. So, maybe I shouldn't divide by 2 because each division is a distinct outcome even if they are inverses of each other. So, perhaps the total number of possible outcomes is 126. I need to clarify this.Let me think: when we randomly divide the numbers into two subsets, each number independently chooses to be in subset A or subset B. So, each of the 2^7 = 128 assignments is equally likely, except for the two cases where all are in A or all are in B, which are excluded. So, the total number of possible outcomes is 126, each with equal probability. Therefore, when calculating probability, I should consider 126 as the denominator.So, moving on, I need to find how many of these divisions result in both subsets having equal sums. Let's denote the total sum of numbers 1 through 7. The sum is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7. Let me calculate that: 1+7=8, 2+6=8, 3+5=8, and then 4 is left. So, 8 + 8 + 8 + 4 = 28. So, the total sum is 28. If we divide this into two subsets with equal sums, each subset must sum to 14.Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the number of subsets of {1,2,3,4,5,6,7} that sum to 14. Because if such a subset exists, its complement will also sum to 14. So, the number of valid divisions is equal to the number of subsets that sum to 14, divided by 2 (since each division is counted twice, once as subset A and once as subset B). But wait, actually, in the total number of divisions, each division is counted once as a specific assignment, so maybe I don't need to divide by 2 here.Wait, let me clarify. If I find the number of subsets that sum to 14, each such subset corresponds to a unique division where subset A has the subset and subset B has the complement. Since the problem counts each division as a distinct outcome, even if they are inverses, then the number of favorable outcomes is equal to the number of subsets that sum to 14. But actually, no, because each division is a pair of subsets, so if I count the number of subsets that sum to 14, each division is uniquely determined by such a subset. So, the number of favorable outcomes is equal to the number of subsets that sum to 14.But wait, actually, no. Because if I have a subset S that sums to 14, then its complement also sums to 14, so each division is counted twice in the count of subsets. So, if I have N subsets that sum to 14, then the number of unique divisions is N/2. But in the total number of possible divisions, which is 126, each division is a unique assignment, so each division is counted once. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing.Let me try a different approach. Instead of thinking about subsets, let's think about the number of ways to assign each number to subset A or subset B such that the sum of subset A is 14. Since each assignment is equally likely, the number of favorable assignments is equal to the number of subsets that sum to 14 multiplied by 2 (since each subset can be assigned to A or B). Wait, no, because each assignment is a specific subset A and subset B. So, if a subset S sums to 14, then the assignment where A = S and B = complement(S) is one favorable outcome, and the assignment where A = complement(S) and B = S is another favorable outcome. So, each subset S that sums to 14 corresponds to two favorable assignments.But in our total number of possible assignments, which is 126, each of these two assignments is distinct. Therefore, the number of favorable assignments is 2 * N, where N is the number of subsets that sum to 14. So, if I can find N, the number of subsets that sum to 14, then the number of favorable assignments is 2N, and the probability is 2N / 126, which simplifies to N / 63.Therefore, my task reduces to finding N, the number of subsets of {1,2,3,4,5,6,7} that sum to 14.So, how do I find N? I can approach this by enumerating all possible subsets and counting those that sum to 14. Since the set is small, this might be feasible.Alternatively, I can use a more systematic approach, perhaps using dynamic programming or combinatorial methods. Let me try to list them.First, note that the total sum is 28, so subsets that sum to 14 are exactly half of the total. So, the number of such subsets is equal to the number of subsets that sum to 14, which is the same as the number of subsets that sum to 14 in the complement.So, let's try to list all subsets of {1,2,3,4,5,6,7} that sum to 14.I can start by considering subsets of different sizes.First, single-element subsets: clearly, none of them sum to 14.Two-element subsets: Let's see which pairs add up to 14.Looking for a + b = 14, where a and b are distinct numbers from 1 to 7.The possible pairs:7 + 7 = 14, but duplicates aren't allowed.6 + 8 = 14, but 8 isn't in the set.Wait, 7 + 7 isn't allowed, so the maximum two-element sum is 7 + 6 = 13, which is less than 14. So, there are no two-element subsets that sum to 14.Three-element subsets: Let's find triplets that sum to 14.We can list all possible triplets and check their sums.Alternatively, think of combinations:Start with 7: 7 + x + y = 14 => x + y = 7.Possible pairs (x,y) where x + y =7, x < y, and x,y ‚â†7.Possible pairs: (1,6), (2,5), (3,4).So, the triplets are {7,1,6}, {7,2,5}, {7,3,4}.So, three subsets.Next, without 7: x + y + z =14, where x,y,z ‚â§6.Looking for triplets without 7 that sum to14.Let me think: 6 is the next highest.6 + x + y =14 => x + y =8.Possible pairs (x,y) where x + y=8, x < y, x,y ‚â§5.Possible pairs: (3,5), (4,4). But duplicates aren't allowed, so only {3,5}.So, the triplet is {6,3,5}.Similarly, 5 + x + y =14 => x + y=9, but since 5 is already used, x and y must be ‚â§4.Wait, no, if we don't include 7 or 6, but 5 is included, then x and y must be ‚â§4.But 5 + x + y =14 => x + y=9, but x and y can be at most 4 each, so 4 + 5=9, but 5 is already used. So, no triplet without 7 and 6 that includes 5.Wait, maybe I'm complicating this. Let me try another approach.List all possible triplets without 7 and see if they sum to14.Possible triplets:1,2,3: sum=61,2,4:71,2,5:81,2,6:91,3,4:81,3,5:91,3,6:101,4,5:101,4,6:111,5,6:122,3,4:92,3,5:102,3,6:112,4,5:112,4,6:122,5,6:133,4,5:123,4,6:133,5,6:144,5,6:15So, from this list, only {3,5,6} sums to14. So, that's one more subset.So, in total, for three-element subsets, we have {7,1,6}, {7,2,5}, {7,3,4}, and {3,5,6}. So, four subsets.Wait, but earlier I thought without 7, only {3,5,6} sums to14, and with 7, we have three subsets. So, total four.Moving on to four-element subsets.Four-element subsets that sum to14.Again, let's consider subsets with 7 and without 7.First, subsets with 7: 7 + x + y + z =14 => x + y + z =7.Looking for triplets (x,y,z) where x + y + z=7, with x,y,z ‚â§6 and distinct.Possible triplets:1,2,4: sum=71,3,3: duplicates, not allowedSo, only {1,2,4}.Therefore, the four-element subset is {7,1,2,4}.Next, subsets without 7: x + y + z + w =14, where x,y,z,w ‚â§6.Looking for four distinct numbers from 1-6 that sum to14.Let me list possible combinations.Start with the largest number, 6:6 + x + y + z =14 => x + y + z=8.Looking for triplets (x,y,z) with x + y + z=8, x < y < z ‚â§5.Possible triplets:1,2,5: sum=81,3,4: sum=8So, two triplets: {1,2,5} and {1,3,4}.Therefore, the four-element subsets are {6,1,2,5} and {6,1,3,4}.Next, without 6:Looking for four numbers from 1-5 that sum to14. The maximum sum is 2+3+4+5=14. So, {2,3,4,5} is a subset that sums to14.So, that's another subset.Therefore, four-element subsets that sum to14 are:{7,1,2,4}, {6,1,2,5}, {6,1,3,4}, and {2,3,4,5}. So, four subsets.Moving on to five-element subsets.Five-element subsets that sum to14.Since the total sum is28, a five-element subset summing to14 implies the complement (a two-element subset) sums to14. But earlier, we saw that there are no two-element subsets that sum to14. Therefore, there are no five-element subsets that sum to14.Wait, let me confirm. If a five-element subset sums to14, then the remaining two elements must sum to14. But as we saw earlier, no two-element subset sums to14, so indeed, there are no five-element subsets that sum to14.Similarly, six-element subsets: their complements are single-element subsets, which can't sum to14. So, no six-element subsets.Seven-element subsets: only the entire set, which sums to28, so not 14.Therefore, the only subsets that sum to14 are the three-element subsets and four-element subsets we found earlier.Wait, let's recount:Three-element subsets: 4 subsets.Four-element subsets: 4 subsets.So, total subsets that sum to14: 4 + 4 = 8.Therefore, N =8.But wait, let me double-check if I missed any subsets.Three-element subsets:1. {7,1,6}2. {7,2,5}3. {7,3,4}4. {3,5,6}Four-element subsets:5. {7,1,2,4}6. {6,1,2,5}7. {6,1,3,4}8. {2,3,4,5}Yes, that's 8 subsets.Therefore, N=8.So, going back, the number of favorable assignments is 2N =16, because each subset corresponds to two assignments (subset A or subset B). But wait, earlier I thought that each subset corresponds to two assignments, but actually, in the total number of assignments, each division is counted twice, so if I have N subsets, each contributing two assignments, but in reality, each division is unique.Wait, perhaps I confused myself earlier.Let me clarify:Each subset S that sums to14 corresponds to exactly one division where S is subset A and its complement is subset B. Since the problem counts each division as a unique outcome, regardless of which subset is A or B, but in reality, in the total number of assignments, each division is represented twice: once as S in A and once as S in B.But in our case, when we count the number of favorable assignments, each subset S that sums to14 gives exactly two favorable assignments: one where S is in A and the other where S is in B. However, in the context of the problem, the division is just the partition into two subsets, so each division is counted once, regardless of which subset is A or B.Wait, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me try to think differently.If I have N subsets that sum to14, each such subset defines a unique division where one subset is S and the other is its complement. Since each division is uniquely determined by the subset S, the number of favorable divisions is N. However, in the total number of possible assignments, which is 126, each division is represented twice (once with S in A and once with S in B). Therefore, if I have N subsets, the number of favorable assignments is 2N, because each division is counted twice.But in our case, the probability is calculated as favorable assignments over total assignments, so it's 2N / 126.But wait, no, because in the problem statement, it's about dividing into two non-empty subsets, so each division is a unique outcome, regardless of the labeling of A and B. So, if we consider the sample space as all possible divisions (each division being an unordered pair {A,B}), then the total number is 63, as earlier calculated (126 /2). In that case, the number of favorable divisions is N, because each subset S corresponds to one division {S, complement(S)}. Therefore, the probability would be N /63.But earlier, I thought the total number of assignments is 126, each equally likely, so the probability would be 2N /126 = N /63. So, same result.Therefore, regardless of whether I think in terms of assignments or divisions, the probability is N /63, where N is the number of subsets that sum to14.Since N=8, the probability is 8 /63.Wait, but let me make sure that N=8 is correct.Earlier, I listed 8 subsets:Three-element subsets:1. {7,1,6}2. {7,2,5}3. {7,3,4}4. {3,5,6}Four-element subsets:5. {7,1,2,4}6. {6,1,2,5}7. {6,1,3,4}8. {2,3,4,5}Yes, that's 8 subsets.Therefore, N=8.So, the probability is 8 /63.But let me confirm if these subsets are all unique and none are duplicates.Looking at the three-element subsets:1. {7,1,6}: unique.2. {7,2,5}: unique.3. {7,3,4}: unique.4. {3,5,6}: unique.Four-element subsets:5. {7,1,2,4}: unique.6. {6,1,2,5}: unique.7. {6,1,3,4}: unique.8. {2,3,4,5}: unique.Yes, all 8 subsets are unique and distinct. So, N=8 is correct.Therefore, the probability is 8 /63. Now, we need to express this fraction in its lowest terms. Let's check if 8 and 63 have any common divisors.63 divided by 7 is 9, and 8 is 2^3. So, the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 8 and 63 is 1. Therefore, the fraction is already in its lowest terms.So, p=8 and q=63. Therefore, p + q=8 +63=71.Therefore, the answer is 71.**Final Answer**boxed{71}"},{"question":"Suppose the graph of the function f(x) = (1 - frac{1}{4}x^2)(x^2 + ax + b) is symmetric about the line x = -1. Find the maximum value of f(x).","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the maximum value of the function ( f(x) = left(1 - frac{1}{4}x^2right)(x^2 + ax + b) ). The graph of this function is symmetric about the line ( x = -1 ). Hmm, symmetry about a vertical line usually means that for every point ( (x, y) ) on the graph, the point ( (-2 - x, y) ) is also on the graph because the axis of symmetry is ( x = -1 ). So, if I take a point ( x ) units to the right of ( -1 ), there should be a corresponding point ( x ) units to the left of ( -1 ) with the same ( y )-value.Let me write that down: for any ( x ), ( f(-2 - x) = f(x) ). That should hold true because of the symmetry. So, if I substitute ( x ) with ( -2 - x ) in the function, it should equal the original function.Let me compute ( f(-2 - x) ):First, compute ( 1 - frac{1}{4}(-2 - x)^2 ):( (-2 - x)^2 = (x + 2)^2 = x^2 + 4x + 4 )So, ( 1 - frac{1}{4}(x^2 + 4x + 4) = 1 - frac{1}{4}x^2 - x - 1 = -frac{1}{4}x^2 - x ).Wait, hold on, that seems off. Let me compute that again:( 1 - frac{1}{4}(x^2 + 4x + 4) = 1 - frac{1}{4}x^2 - x - 1 ). The 1 and -1 cancel out, so it's ( -frac{1}{4}x^2 - x ). Okay, that's correct.Now, compute ( (-2 - x)^2 + a(-2 - x) + b ):First, ( (-2 - x)^2 = x^2 + 4x + 4 )Then, ( a(-2 - x) = -2a - ax )So, adding them together: ( x^2 + 4x + 4 - 2a - ax + b )Combine like terms: ( x^2 + (4 - a)x + (4 - 2a + b) )Therefore, ( f(-2 - x) = left(-frac{1}{4}x^2 - xright)left(x^2 + (4 - a)x + (4 - 2a + b)right) )This should equal ( f(x) = left(1 - frac{1}{4}x^2right)(x^2 + ax + b) )So, set them equal:( left(-frac{1}{4}x^2 - xright)left(x^2 + (4 - a)x + (4 - 2a + b)right) = left(1 - frac{1}{4}x^2right)(x^2 + ax + b) )This equation must hold for all ( x ), so the coefficients of corresponding powers of ( x ) must be equal on both sides.Let me expand both sides.First, the left-hand side (LHS):Multiply ( -frac{1}{4}x^2 ) with each term in the second polynomial:- ( -frac{1}{4}x^2 times x^2 = -frac{1}{4}x^4 )- ( -frac{1}{4}x^2 times (4 - a)x = -frac{1}{4}(4 - a)x^3 = - (1 - frac{a}{4})x^3 )- ( -frac{1}{4}x^2 times (4 - 2a + b) = -frac{1}{4}(4 - 2a + b)x^2 )Now, multiply ( -x ) with each term in the second polynomial:- ( -x times x^2 = -x^3 )- ( -x times (4 - a)x = - (4 - a)x^2 )- ( -x times (4 - 2a + b) = - (4 - 2a + b)x )So, combining all terms on the LHS:- ( -frac{1}{4}x^4 )- ( - (1 - frac{a}{4})x^3 - x^3 = - (1 - frac{a}{4} + 1)x^3 = - (2 - frac{a}{4})x^3 )- ( -frac{1}{4}(4 - 2a + b)x^2 - (4 - a)x^2 = left(-frac{1}{4}(4 - 2a + b) - (4 - a)right)x^2 )- ( - (4 - 2a + b)x )Simplify each coefficient:For the ( x^4 ) term: ( -frac{1}{4} )For the ( x^3 ) term: ( -2 + frac{a}{4} )For the ( x^2 ) term:First term: ( -frac{1}{4}(4 - 2a + b) = -1 + frac{a}{2} - frac{b}{4} )Second term: ( - (4 - a) = -4 + a )Combine them: ( (-1 + frac{a}{2} - frac{b}{4}) + (-4 + a) = -5 + frac{3a}{2} - frac{b}{4} )For the ( x ) term: ( - (4 - 2a + b) = -4 + 2a - b )So, LHS is:( -frac{1}{4}x^4 + left(-2 + frac{a}{4}right)x^3 + left(-5 + frac{3a}{2} - frac{b}{4}right)x^2 + (-4 + 2a - b)x )Now, the right-hand side (RHS):Multiply ( 1 ) with each term in the second polynomial:- ( 1 times x^2 = x^2 )- ( 1 times a x = a x )- ( 1 times b = b )Multiply ( -frac{1}{4}x^2 ) with each term in the second polynomial:- ( -frac{1}{4}x^2 times x^2 = -frac{1}{4}x^4 )- ( -frac{1}{4}x^2 times a x = -frac{a}{4}x^3 )- ( -frac{1}{4}x^2 times b = -frac{b}{4}x^2 )Combine all terms on RHS:- ( -frac{1}{4}x^4 )- ( -frac{a}{4}x^3 )- ( x^2 - frac{b}{4}x^2 = left(1 - frac{b}{4}right)x^2 )- ( a x )- ( b )So, RHS is:( -frac{1}{4}x^4 - frac{a}{4}x^3 + left(1 - frac{b}{4}right)x^2 + a x + b )Now, set LHS equal to RHS:LHS: ( -frac{1}{4}x^4 + left(-2 + frac{a}{4}right)x^3 + left(-5 + frac{3a}{2} - frac{b}{4}right)x^2 + (-4 + 2a - b)x )RHS: ( -frac{1}{4}x^4 - frac{a}{4}x^3 + left(1 - frac{b}{4}right)x^2 + a x + b )Now, equate coefficients for each power of ( x ):1. For ( x^4 ): Both sides have ( -frac{1}{4} ), so that's already equal.2. For ( x^3 ):LHS: ( -2 + frac{a}{4} )RHS: ( -frac{a}{4} )So, set equal:( -2 + frac{a}{4} = -frac{a}{4} )Solve for ( a ):Add ( frac{a}{4} ) to both sides:( -2 + frac{a}{2} = 0 )So, ( frac{a}{2} = 2 )Multiply both sides by 2:( a = 4 )3. For ( x^2 ):LHS: ( -5 + frac{3a}{2} - frac{b}{4} )RHS: ( 1 - frac{b}{4} )Set equal:( -5 + frac{3a}{2} - frac{b}{4} = 1 - frac{b}{4} )Simplify: Add ( frac{b}{4} ) to both sides:( -5 + frac{3a}{2} = 1 )We already found ( a = 4 ), so plug that in:( -5 + frac{3*4}{2} = -5 + 6 = 1 )Which equals RHS: 1. So, that's consistent. No new information here.4. For ( x ):LHS: ( -4 + 2a - b )RHS: ( a )Set equal:( -4 + 2a - b = a )Simplify:( -4 + a - b = 0 )So, ( a - b = 4 )We know ( a = 4 ), so plug in:( 4 - b = 4 )Thus, ( -b = 0 ) => ( b = 0 )5. For the constant term:Wait, on LHS, there is no constant term, but on RHS, there is a constant term ( b ). So, setting them equal:LHS constant term: 0RHS constant term: ( b )Thus, ( 0 = b )Which is consistent with what we found earlier, ( b = 0 )So, from this, we have ( a = 4 ) and ( b = 0 ).Therefore, the function becomes:( f(x) = left(1 - frac{1}{4}x^2right)(x^2 + 4x) )Simplify this:First, expand ( x^2 + 4x ):It's already factored, but let's multiply it out with the first term.( f(x) = left(1 - frac{1}{4}x^2right)(x^2 + 4x) )Multiply term by term:1. ( 1 times x^2 = x^2 )2. ( 1 times 4x = 4x )3. ( -frac{1}{4}x^2 times x^2 = -frac{1}{4}x^4 )4. ( -frac{1}{4}x^2 times 4x = -x^3 )So, combining all terms:( f(x) = x^2 + 4x - frac{1}{4}x^4 - x^3 )Let me write it in standard form:( f(x) = -frac{1}{4}x^4 - x^3 + x^2 + 4x )Now, to find the maximum value of ( f(x) ), we need to find its critical points by taking the derivative and setting it equal to zero.Compute ( f'(x) ):( f'(x) = frac{d}{dx}left(-frac{1}{4}x^4 - x^3 + x^2 + 4xright) )( f'(x) = -x^3 - 3x^2 + 2x + 4 )Set ( f'(x) = 0 ):( -x^3 - 3x^2 + 2x + 4 = 0 )Multiply both sides by -1 to make it easier:( x^3 + 3x^2 - 2x - 4 = 0 )Now, we need to solve this cubic equation. Let's try to find rational roots using Rational Root Theorem. Possible rational roots are factors of the constant term over factors of the leading coefficient. So, possible roots are ( pm1, pm2, pm4 ).Test ( x = 1 ):( 1 + 3 - 2 - 4 = -2 neq 0 )Test ( x = -1 ):( -1 + 3 + 2 - 4 = 0 ). Oh, ( x = -1 ) is a root.So, factor out ( (x + 1) ) from the cubic:Use polynomial division or synthetic division.Using synthetic division with root ( x = -1 ):Coefficients: 1 (x^3), 3 (x^2), -2 (x), -4 (constant)Bring down 1.Multiply by -1: 1*(-1) = -1. Add to next coefficient: 3 + (-1) = 2.Multiply by -1: 2*(-1) = -2. Add to next coefficient: -2 + (-2) = -4.Multiply by -1: -4*(-1) = 4. Add to last coefficient: -4 + 4 = 0.So, the cubic factors as ( (x + 1)(x^2 + 2x - 4) ).Therefore, the equation becomes:( (x + 1)(x^2 + 2x - 4) = 0 )So, roots are ( x = -1 ) and solutions to ( x^2 + 2x - 4 = 0 ).Solve ( x^2 + 2x - 4 = 0 ):Using quadratic formula:( x = frac{-2 pm sqrt{4 + 16}}{2} = frac{-2 pm sqrt{20}}{2} = frac{-2 pm 2sqrt{5}}{2} = -1 pm sqrt{5} )So, critical points are ( x = -1 ), ( x = -1 + sqrt{5} ), and ( x = -1 - sqrt{5} ).Now, we need to determine which of these critical points correspond to maxima.We can use the second derivative test or analyze the sign changes of the first derivative.Compute the second derivative ( f''(x) ):( f'(x) = -x^3 - 3x^2 + 2x + 4 )( f''(x) = -3x^2 - 6x + 2 )Evaluate ( f''(x) ) at each critical point:1. At ( x = -1 ):( f''(-1) = -3(-1)^2 - 6(-1) + 2 = -3(1) + 6 + 2 = -3 + 6 + 2 = 5 )Since ( f''(-1) > 0 ), this is a local minimum.2. At ( x = -1 + sqrt{5} ):First, compute ( x = -1 + sqrt{5} approx -1 + 2.236 = 1.236 )Compute ( f''(1.236) ):( f''(x) = -3x^2 - 6x + 2 )Plug in ( x = -1 + sqrt{5} ):Let me compute it symbolically:( f''(-1 + sqrt{5}) = -3(-1 + sqrt{5})^2 - 6(-1 + sqrt{5}) + 2 )First, compute ( (-1 + sqrt{5})^2 = 1 - 2sqrt{5} + 5 = 6 - 2sqrt{5} )So,( f''(-1 + sqrt{5}) = -3(6 - 2sqrt{5}) -6(-1 + sqrt{5}) + 2 )= ( -18 + 6sqrt{5} + 6 - 6sqrt{5} + 2 )Simplify:-18 + 6 = -12; 6‚àö5 -6‚àö5 = 0; -12 + 2 = -10So, ( f''(-1 + sqrt{5}) = -10 )Since this is negative, this critical point is a local maximum.3. At ( x = -1 - sqrt{5} ):Compute ( f''(-1 - sqrt{5}) ):Again, compute symbolically:( f''(-1 - sqrt{5}) = -3(-1 - sqrt{5})^2 - 6(-1 - sqrt{5}) + 2 )First, compute ( (-1 - sqrt{5})^2 = 1 + 2sqrt{5} + 5 = 6 + 2sqrt{5} )So,( f''(-1 - sqrt{5}) = -3(6 + 2sqrt{5}) -6(-1 - sqrt{5}) + 2 )= ( -18 - 6sqrt{5} + 6 + 6sqrt{5} + 2 )Simplify:-18 + 6 + 2 = -10; -6‚àö5 +6‚àö5 = 0So, ( f''(-1 - sqrt{5}) = -10 )Again, negative, so this is also a local maximum.Therefore, we have two local maxima at ( x = -1 + sqrt{5} ) and ( x = -1 - sqrt{5} ).Now, we need to find the maximum value of ( f(x) ). Since the function is a quartic with a negative leading coefficient, it tends to negative infinity as ( x ) approaches positive or negative infinity. Therefore, the global maximum must be at one of these local maxima.Compute ( f(-1 + sqrt{5}) ) and ( f(-1 - sqrt{5}) ). Since the function is symmetric about ( x = -1 ), these two points are symmetric with respect to ( x = -1 ). Therefore, their function values should be equal.Let me compute ( f(-1 + sqrt{5}) ):First, compute ( f(x) = left(1 - frac{1}{4}x^2right)(x^2 + 4x) )Let me denote ( x = -1 + sqrt{5} ). Let me compute each part step by step.Compute ( x^2 ):( x = -1 + sqrt{5} )( x^2 = (-1 + sqrt{5})^2 = 1 - 2sqrt{5} + 5 = 6 - 2sqrt{5} )Compute ( 1 - frac{1}{4}x^2 ):= ( 1 - frac{1}{4}(6 - 2sqrt{5}) )= ( 1 - frac{6}{4} + frac{2sqrt{5}}{4} )= ( 1 - frac{3}{2} + frac{sqrt{5}}{2} )= ( -frac{1}{2} + frac{sqrt{5}}{2} )= ( frac{sqrt{5} - 1}{2} )Compute ( x^2 + 4x ):We already have ( x^2 = 6 - 2sqrt{5} )Compute ( 4x = 4(-1 + sqrt{5}) = -4 + 4sqrt{5} )So, ( x^2 + 4x = (6 - 2sqrt{5}) + (-4 + 4sqrt{5}) = 2 + 2sqrt{5} )Therefore, ( f(x) = left(frac{sqrt{5} - 1}{2}right)(2 + 2sqrt{5}) )Simplify:Multiply numerator terms:( (sqrt{5} - 1)(2 + 2sqrt{5}) = 2(sqrt{5} - 1) + 2sqrt{5}(sqrt{5} - 1) )= ( 2sqrt{5} - 2 + 2*5 - 2sqrt{5} )= ( 2sqrt{5} - 2 + 10 - 2sqrt{5} )= ( (2sqrt{5} - 2sqrt{5}) + (-2 + 10) )= ( 0 + 8 = 8 )So, ( f(x) = frac{8}{2} = 4 )Therefore, ( f(-1 + sqrt{5}) = 4 ). Similarly, due to symmetry, ( f(-1 - sqrt{5}) = 4 ).Hence, the maximum value of ( f(x) ) is 4.**Final Answer**The maximum value of ( f(x) ) is boxed{4}."},{"question":"If John travels 15 miles on a bike ride, and Jill travels 5 miles less, how many miles does Jim travel if he travels only 20% as far as Jill?","answer":"First, I need to determine how far Jill travels. Since John travels 15 miles and Jill travels 5 miles less than John, I subtract 5 from 15 to find Jill's distance.Next, I calculate how far Jim travels. Jim travels only 20% as far as Jill. To find 20% of Jill's distance, I multiply Jill's distance by 0.2.Finally, I present the calculated distance that Jim travels."},{"question":"Pat has ten tests to write in the school year. He can obtain a maximum score of 100 on each test. The average score of Pat's first eight tests is 80 and the average score of all of Pat's tests is ( N ). What is the maximum possible value of ( N )?","answer":"Okay, so Pat has ten tests in the school year, and each test can have a maximum score of 100. The average score of the first eight tests is 80, and we need to find the maximum possible value of the average score ( N ) for all ten tests. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, I know that the average score is calculated by taking the total sum of all scores and dividing it by the number of tests. So, if the average of the first eight tests is 80, then the total sum of those eight tests must be ( 8 times 80 ). Let me calculate that:( 8 times 80 = 640 )So, the total score for the first eight tests is 640. Now, since each test can have a maximum score of 100, the next two tests (the ninth and tenth) can each contribute up to 100 points. To maximize the overall average ( N ), Pat should score the maximum on these remaining two tests. That means scoring 100 on both the ninth and tenth tests.So, the total score for the last two tests would be ( 100 + 100 = 200 ). Adding that to the previous total of 640 gives:( 640 + 200 = 840 )Now, to find the average ( N ) for all ten tests, we take the total score of 840 and divide it by 10:( N = frac{840}{10} = 84 )Wait, let me double-check that. The first eight tests sum to 640, the last two add 200, so total is 840. Divided by 10 tests, that's 84. That seems right.But just to make sure I didn't make a mistake, let me go through it again. The average of the first eight is 80, so 8 times 80 is 640. Each of the next two can be 100, so 2 times 100 is 200. 640 plus 200 is 840. 840 divided by 10 is 84. Yep, that checks out.I don't think there's any way to get a higher average because 100 is the maximum on each test. So, if Pat scores 100 on both remaining tests, that's the highest possible total. If he scored less than 100 on either, the average would be lower. So, 84 must be the maximum possible value of ( N ).Just to think about it another way, if all ten tests were 100, the average would be 100. But since the first eight are only averaging 80, that drags the overall average down. So, the maximum we can do is to make up as much as possible with the last two tests. Each of those can add 20 points above the 80 average. So, each test can contribute an extra 20 points beyond the 80 average.Wait, let me explain that. The first eight tests have an average of 80, which is 20 points below the maximum of 100. So, each of the last two tests can add 20 points to the average. Since there are two tests, that's 20 times 2, which is 40. But wait, how does that affect the overall average?Actually, maybe I confused something there. Let me try to think of it in terms of total points. The first eight tests are 640, which is 80 times 8. The maximum total for all ten tests would be 1000 (10 times 100). But since the first eight are fixed at 640, the last two can only add 200, making the total 840. So, the maximum average is 840 divided by 10, which is 84. So, that's consistent with what I had before.Alternatively, thinking about how much each test contributes to the average. The first eight tests contribute 80 each, so 80 times 8 is 640. The last two can contribute 100 each, so 100 times 2 is 200. So, 640 plus 200 is 840, divided by 10 is 84. So, that's another way to see it.I think I've confirmed it multiple ways now, so I feel confident that 84 is the correct maximum average Pat can achieve.**Final Answer**The maximum possible value of ( N ) is boxed{84}."},{"question":"Suppose that (x_{1}, x_{2}), and (x_{3}) are the three roots of ((11-x)^{3}+(13-x)^{3}=(24-2x)^{3}). Find the value of (x_{1}+x_{2}+x_{3}).","answer":"Alright, so I have this equation: ((11 - x)^3 + (13 - x)^3 = (24 - 2x)^3). I need to find the sum of its roots, (x_1 + x_2 + x_3). Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that for a cubic equation of the form (ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0), the sum of the roots is given by (-b/a). So, if I can rewrite the given equation in standard cubic form, I can easily find the sum of the roots.Let me start by expanding both sides of the equation. Maybe that will help me simplify it into a standard cubic equation.Starting with the left side: ((11 - x)^3 + (13 - x)^3).I know the formula for expanding ((a - b)^3) is (a^3 - 3a^2b + 3ab^2 - b^3). So, let me apply that to both terms.First, expand ((11 - x)^3):- (11^3 = 1331)- (3 times 11^2 times x = 3 times 121 times x = 363x)- (3 times 11 times x^2 = 33x^2)- (x^3)So, ((11 - x)^3 = 1331 - 363x + 33x^2 - x^3).Similarly, expand ((13 - x)^3):- (13^3 = 2197)- (3 times 13^2 times x = 3 times 169 times x = 507x)- (3 times 13 times x^2 = 39x^2)- (x^3)So, ((13 - x)^3 = 2197 - 507x + 39x^2 - x^3).Now, add these two expansions together:Left side = ((1331 - 363x + 33x^2 - x^3) + (2197 - 507x + 39x^2 - x^3))Combine like terms:- Constants: 1331 + 2197 = 3528- x terms: -363x - 507x = -870x- x^2 terms: 33x^2 + 39x^2 = 72x^2- x^3 terms: -x^3 - x^3 = -2x^3So, left side simplifies to: (3528 - 870x + 72x^2 - 2x^3).Now, let's look at the right side: ((24 - 2x)^3).Again, using the expansion formula:- (24^3 = 13824)- (3 times 24^2 times 2x = 3 times 576 times 2x = 3456x)- (3 times 24 times (2x)^2 = 3 times 24 times 4x^2 = 288x^2)- ((2x)^3 = 8x^3)So, ((24 - 2x)^3 = 13824 - 3456x + 288x^2 - 8x^3).Now, set the left side equal to the right side:(3528 - 870x + 72x^2 - 2x^3 = 13824 - 3456x + 288x^2 - 8x^3).Let's bring all terms to one side to set the equation to zero. Subtract the right side from both sides:(3528 - 870x + 72x^2 - 2x^3 - 13824 + 3456x - 288x^2 + 8x^3 = 0).Now, combine like terms:- Constants: 3528 - 13824 = -10296- x terms: -870x + 3456x = 2586x- x^2 terms: 72x^2 - 288x^2 = -216x^2- x^3 terms: -2x^3 + 8x^3 = 6x^3So, the equation becomes: (6x^3 - 216x^2 + 2586x - 10296 = 0).Hmm, that's a cubic equation. Let me write it as:(6x^3 - 216x^2 + 2586x - 10296 = 0).I can factor out a common factor to simplify this equation. Let's see, all coefficients are divisible by 6.Divide each term by 6:(x^3 - 36x^2 + 431x - 1716 = 0).So, the simplified cubic equation is (x^3 - 36x^2 + 431x - 1716 = 0).Now, according to Vieta's formula, the sum of the roots (x_1 + x_2 + x_3) is equal to the coefficient of (x^2) term with the opposite sign. In this case, the coefficient of (x^2) is -36, so the sum of the roots is 36.Wait, hold on. Let me double-check that.Vieta's formula says that for a cubic equation (ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0), the sum of roots is (-b/a). Here, (a = 1) and (b = -36), so the sum is (-(-36)/1 = 36). Yep, that seems right.But just to be thorough, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in expanding or combining terms earlier.Starting with the left side: ((11 - x)^3 + (13 - x)^3). Expanded correctly, I think.11^3 is 1331, 13^3 is 2197. Then, the coefficients for x, x^2, and x^3 terms seem correct.Adding them together: 1331 + 2197 is 3528, correct. -363x -507x is -870x, correct. 33x^2 + 39x^2 is 72x^2, correct. -x^3 -x^3 is -2x^3, correct.Right side: (24 - 2x)^3. 24^3 is 13824, correct. 3*(24)^2*(2x) is 3*576*2x = 3456x, correct. 3*24*(2x)^2 is 3*24*4x^2 = 288x^2, correct. (2x)^3 is 8x^3, correct.Subtracting right side from left side: 3528 - 13824 is -10296, correct. -870x + 3456x is 2586x, correct. 72x^2 - 288x^2 is -216x^2, correct. -2x^3 + 8x^3 is 6x^3, correct.Divide by 6: x^3 - 36x^2 + 431x - 1716 = 0. Correct.So, Vieta's formula gives sum of roots as 36. Hmm, seems solid.But wait, just to be extra careful, maybe I can test if the original equation has any obvious roots that I can factor out, which might help confirm.Let me plug in x = 11 into the original equation: (11 - 11)^3 + (13 - 11)^3 = (24 - 22)^3 => 0 + 2^3 = 2^3 => 8 = 8. So, x = 11 is a root.Similarly, x = 13: (11 -13)^3 + (13 -13)^3 = (24 -26)^3 => (-2)^3 + 0 = (-2)^3 => -8 = -8. So, x =13 is also a root.And x = 12: Let's see, (11 -12)^3 + (13 -12)^3 = (-1)^3 + (1)^3 = -1 +1 = 0. On the right side, (24 -24)^3 = 0^3 = 0. So, x=12 is also a root.So, the roots are 11, 12, and 13. Therefore, their sum is 11 +12 +13 = 36. Perfect, that matches with what I found earlier.So, I think that confirms it. The sum is 36.**Final Answer**The value of (x_{1} + x_{2} + x_{3}) is boxed{36}."},{"question":"How many different pairs (m, n) can be formed using numbers from the list of integers {1, 2, 3, ..., 20} such that m < n and m + n is even? (A) 55  (B) 90  (C) 140  (D) 110  (E) 50","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find how many different pairs (m, n) can be formed using numbers from the list {1, 2, 3, ..., 20} such that m < n and m + n is even. The options are (A) 55, (B) 90, (C) 140, (D) 110, (E) 50.Hmm, let me think about this step by step. First, I know that when adding two numbers, the result is even if both numbers are even or both are odd. So, m + n is even in two cases: either both m and n are even, or both are odd.So, maybe I can break this problem into two parts: counting the number of pairs where both are even and both are odd, then adding them together.Let me first figure out how many even numbers are there in the list from 1 to 20. Well, every other number is even, so that's 10 even numbers: 2, 4, 6, ..., 20.Similarly, the number of odd numbers is also 10: 1, 3, 5, ..., 19.Okay, so now, for the even numbers, how many pairs can I form where m < n? Since all the even numbers are in the list, and I need to choose two distinct numbers where the first is less than the second. That's a combination problem.The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k! (n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number we want to choose.So, for the even numbers, n = 10, k = 2. So, C(10, 2) = 10! / (2! * 8!) = (10 * 9) / (2 * 1) = 45. So, 45 pairs where both m and n are even.Similarly, for the odd numbers, it's the same calculation. There are 10 odd numbers, so C(10, 2) is also 45. So, 45 pairs where both m and n are odd.Therefore, the total number of pairs where m + n is even is 45 + 45 = 90.Wait, but hold on, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem says \\"different pairs (m, n)\\" with m < n. So, each pair is unique and ordered such that m is less than n. So, combinations are the right approach here because order doesn't matter beyond the m < n condition.So, adding the two combinations together, 45 + 45 = 90. So, the answer should be 90, which is option (B).But just to double-check, let me think about the total number of possible pairs where m < n. The total number of such pairs from 20 numbers is C(20, 2) = (20 * 19)/2 = 190.Out of these 190 pairs, how many have m + n even? Well, as we said, it's the sum of pairs where both are even and both are odd. So, 45 + 45 = 90, which is exactly half of 190. Wait, 90 is half of 190? No, 190 divided by 2 is 95. Hmm, so 90 is less than half. That seems a bit odd.Wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Let me think again. If there are equal numbers of even and odd numbers, then the number of pairs where both are even should be equal to the number of pairs where both are odd, right? Because both have 10 numbers each.But 10 choose 2 is 45, so 45 + 45 is 90. So, 90 is the number of pairs where m + n is even. The total number of pairs is 190, so 90 is less than half, but that's okay because when you have an even split between even and odd numbers, the number of even sums is equal to the number of odd sums? Wait, no, actually, no.Wait, let's see: the total number of pairs is 190. The number of pairs where m + n is even is 90, so the number of pairs where m + n is odd must be 100, because 90 + 100 = 190.Wait, that seems a bit off. Let me calculate the number of pairs where m + n is odd. For that, one number has to be even and the other odd. So, the number of such pairs is 10 * 10 = 100, because for each even number, you can pair it with each odd number.So, 100 pairs where m + n is odd, and 90 pairs where m + n is even. So, 100 + 90 = 190, which matches the total number of pairs. So, that seems correct.Therefore, the number of pairs where m + n is even is 90, which is option (B).Wait, but hold on, let me think again. Is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe by considering the positions or something else?Alternatively, since m < n, and m + n is even, so m and n must be both even or both odd. So, as I did before, the number of such pairs is C(10, 2) + C(10, 2) = 45 + 45 = 90.Alternatively, another way to think about it is: for each number, count how many numbers after it are of the same parity.For example, take the number 1. It's odd. How many numbers after it are odd? From 3 to 19, that's 9 numbers. So, 9 pairs starting with 1.Similarly, take 2. It's even. Numbers after it that are even: 4, 6, ..., 20, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 pairs starting with 2.Take 3. It's odd. Numbers after it that are odd: 5, 7, ..., 19, which is 8 numbers. So, 8 pairs.Similarly, 4 is even. Numbers after it that are even: 6, 8, ..., 20, which is 8 numbers.Continuing this way, for each number, the number of pairs it can form with numbers after it of the same parity decreases by 1 each time.So, for the first 10 numbers (1 to 10):- 1: 9 pairs- 2: 9 pairs- 3: 8 pairs- 4: 8 pairs- 5: 7 pairs- 6: 7 pairs- 7: 6 pairs- 8: 6 pairs- 9: 5 pairs- 10: 5 pairsWait, hold on, let me verify. For 1, which is odd, numbers after it that are odd: 3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19. That's 9 numbers.Similarly, for 2, which is even, numbers after it that are even: 4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20. That's 9 numbers.For 3, odd: numbers after it that are odd: 5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19. That's 8 numbers.For 4, even: numbers after it that are even: 6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20. That's 8 numbers.Similarly, 5: 7 pairs, 6:7 pairs, and so on until 10:5 pairs.So, adding these up:For the odd numbers (1,3,5,7,9):9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 = 35For the even numbers (2,4,6,8,10):9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 = 35So, total pairs: 35 + 35 = 70.Wait, that's only 70. But earlier, I calculated 90. Hmm, so which one is correct?Wait, maybe I made a mistake in this approach. Because when I considered numbers from 1 to 10, but actually, the numbers go up to 20. So, perhaps I need to consider all 20 numbers.Wait, let me try again. Let's list all the numbers from 1 to 20, and for each number, count how many numbers after it are of the same parity.So, starting with 1: odd, numbers after it that are odd: 3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19. That's 9 numbers.2: even, numbers after it that are even: 4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20. That's 9 numbers.3: odd, numbers after it that are odd: 5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19. 8 numbers.4: even, numbers after it that are even: 6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20. 8 numbers.5: odd, numbers after it that are odd: 7,9,11,13,15,17,19. 7 numbers.6: even, numbers after it that are even: 8,10,12,14,16,18,20. 7 numbers.7: odd, numbers after it that are odd: 9,11,13,15,17,19. 6 numbers.8: even, numbers after it that are even: 10,12,14,16,18,20. 6 numbers.9: odd, numbers after it that are odd: 11,13,15,17,19. 5 numbers.10: even, numbers after it that are even: 12,14,16,18,20. 5 numbers.11: odd, numbers after it that are odd: 13,15,17,19. 4 numbers.12: even, numbers after it that are even: 14,16,18,20. 4 numbers.13: odd, numbers after it that are odd: 15,17,19. 3 numbers.14: even, numbers after it that are even: 16,18,20. 3 numbers.15: odd, numbers after it that are odd: 17,19. 2 numbers.16: even, numbers after it that are even: 18,20. 2 numbers.17: odd, numbers after it that are odd: 19. 1 number.18: even, numbers after it that are even: 20. 1 number.19: odd, numbers after it that are odd: none.20: even, numbers after it that are even: none.So, now, let's add up all these numbers:For the odd numbers:1:9, 3:8, 5:7, 7:6, 9:5, 11:4, 13:3, 15:2, 17:1, 19:0.So, adding these: 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 0.That's the sum of the first 9 positive integers: (9*10)/2 = 45.Similarly, for the even numbers:2:9, 4:8, 6:7, 8:6, 10:5, 12:4, 14:3, 16:2, 18:1, 20:0.Adding these: 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 0.Same as above, which is 45.So, total pairs: 45 (from odd) + 45 (from even) = 90.Ah, okay, so that's consistent with my first method. So, the correct answer is 90, which is option (B).Wait, so earlier when I was only considering numbers up to 10, I was getting 70, but that was incorrect because I didn't consider all the numbers up to 20. So, when I considered all 20 numbers, it added up correctly to 90.So, that confirms that the answer is 90.Alternatively, another way to think about it is that in the list from 1 to 20, there are 10 even and 10 odd numbers. The number of ways to choose two even numbers is C(10,2) = 45, and the number of ways to choose two odd numbers is also C(10,2) = 45. So, total pairs where m + n is even is 45 + 45 = 90.Yes, that seems consistent.So, I think I've verified it in multiple ways, so I'm confident that the answer is 90, which is option (B).**Final Answer**boxed{B}"},{"question":"(1) Given x > -1, find the minimum value of the function y = x + frac{4}{x+1} + 6;(2) Find the extremum of the function y = frac{x^2 + 8}{x-1}, where x > 1.","answer":"Okay, so I have two calculus problems to solve. Let me take them one at a time. Starting with the first problem: Given ( x > -1 ), find the minimum value of the function ( y = x + frac{4}{x+1} + 6 ). Hmm, this looks like an optimization problem. I remember that to find the minimum or maximum of a function, I can use calculus, specifically finding the derivative and setting it equal to zero to find critical points. Alright, let me write down the function again: ( y = x + frac{4}{x+1} + 6 ). Since ( x > -1 ), the denominator ( x+1 ) is positive, so the function is defined and smooth in this interval. First, I need to find the derivative of ( y ) with respect to ( x ). Let's compute that step by step. The derivative of ( x ) with respect to ( x ) is 1. Next, the derivative of ( frac{4}{x+1} ). I can rewrite this as ( 4(x+1)^{-1} ). Using the power rule, the derivative is ( 4 times (-1) times (x+1)^{-2} times 1 ), which simplifies to ( -frac{4}{(x+1)^2} ).The derivative of the constant term 6 is 0. So putting it all together, the derivative ( y' ) is:( y' = 1 - frac{4}{(x+1)^2} ).Now, to find the critical points, I set ( y' = 0 ):( 1 - frac{4}{(x+1)^2} = 0 ).Let me solve for ( x ). First, move the fraction to the other side:( 1 = frac{4}{(x+1)^2} ).Multiply both sides by ( (x+1)^2 ):( (x+1)^2 = 4 ).Take the square root of both sides:( x + 1 = pm 2 ).But since ( x > -1 ), ( x + 1 ) must be positive. Therefore, we discard the negative root:( x + 1 = 2 ) => ( x = 1 ).So, the critical point is at ( x = 1 ). Now, I need to check if this is a minimum or maximum. For that, I can use the second derivative test or analyze the sign changes of the first derivative.Let me compute the second derivative. Starting from the first derivative:( y' = 1 - frac{4}{(x+1)^2} ).Differentiate again:The derivative of 1 is 0.For the second term, ( -4(x+1)^{-2} ), the derivative is ( -4 times (-2) times (x+1)^{-3} times 1 ), which is ( 8/(x+1)^3 ).So, the second derivative ( y'' ) is:( y'' = frac{8}{(x+1)^3} ).Now, evaluate ( y'' ) at ( x = 1 ):( y''(1) = frac{8}{(1+1)^3} = frac{8}{8} = 1 ).Since ( y''(1) > 0 ), the function is concave upward at this point, which means it's a local minimum. Therefore, the minimum occurs at ( x = 1 ). Now, let's find the value of ( y ) at this point:( y(1) = 1 + frac{4}{1+1} + 6 = 1 + frac{4}{2} + 6 = 1 + 2 + 6 = 9 ).So, the minimum value of the function is 9 at ( x = 1 ).Wait, before I conclude, let me just double-check my calculations. First derivative: ( y' = 1 - 4/(x+1)^2 ). Setting to zero: ( 1 = 4/(x+1)^2 ) => ( (x+1)^2 = 4 ) => ( x+1 = 2 ) => ( x = 1 ). Correct.Second derivative: ( y'' = 8/(x+1)^3 ). At ( x = 1 ), it's 8/8 = 1, which is positive. So, yes, it's a minimum. Calculating ( y(1) ): 1 + 4/2 + 6 = 1 + 2 + 6 = 9. That seems right. Okay, so I think that's solid.Moving on to the second problem: Find the extremum of the function ( y = frac{x^2 + 8}{x - 1} ), where ( x > 1 ). Alright, so this is another optimization problem. I need to find the extremum, which could be a minimum or maximum. Since the domain is ( x > 1 ), the function is defined there, but I should check for critical points.First, let me write down the function: ( y = frac{x^2 + 8}{x - 1} ). To find the extremum, I need to find the derivative of ( y ) with respect to ( x ) and set it equal to zero.Let me compute the derivative. Since this is a quotient, I can use the quotient rule. The quotient rule states that if ( y = frac{u}{v} ), then ( y' = frac{u'v - uv'}{v^2} ).Let me assign ( u = x^2 + 8 ) and ( v = x - 1 ).Compute ( u' ): derivative of ( x^2 + 8 ) is ( 2x ).Compute ( v' ): derivative of ( x - 1 ) is 1.Now, applying the quotient rule:( y' = frac{(2x)(x - 1) - (x^2 + 8)(1)}{(x - 1)^2} ).Let me simplify the numerator step by step.First, expand ( (2x)(x - 1) ):( 2x times x = 2x^2 )( 2x times (-1) = -2x )So, ( (2x)(x - 1) = 2x^2 - 2x ).Next, subtract ( (x^2 + 8) times 1 ):So, the numerator becomes:( 2x^2 - 2x - x^2 - 8 ).Combine like terms:( 2x^2 - x^2 = x^2 )( -2x ) remains as is.( -8 ) remains as is.So, numerator simplifies to ( x^2 - 2x - 8 ).Therefore, the derivative ( y' ) is:( y' = frac{x^2 - 2x - 8}{(x - 1)^2} ).Now, to find critical points, set ( y' = 0 ). Since the denominator ( (x - 1)^2 ) is always positive for ( x > 1 ), the critical points occur when the numerator is zero:( x^2 - 2x - 8 = 0 ).Let me solve this quadratic equation.Quadratic equation: ( x^2 - 2x - 8 = 0 ).Using the quadratic formula: ( x = frac{2 pm sqrt{(2)^2 - 4(1)(-8)}}{2(1)} ).Compute discriminant:( 4 + 32 = 36 ).So, ( x = frac{2 pm 6}{2} ).Therefore, two solutions:1. ( x = frac{2 + 6}{2} = frac{8}{2} = 4 ).2. ( x = frac{2 - 6}{2} = frac{-4}{2} = -2 ).But since our domain is ( x > 1 ), we discard ( x = -2 ) as it's not in the domain. So, the only critical point is at ( x = 4 ).Now, we need to determine whether this critical point is a minimum or maximum. Again, I can use the second derivative test or analyze the sign changes of the first derivative.Let me try the second derivative test. First, compute the second derivative.But before that, maybe it's easier to analyze the sign of the first derivative around ( x = 4 ).So, let's pick test points in the intervals ( (1, 4) ) and ( (4, infty) ).First interval: Let's choose ( x = 2 ).Compute numerator of ( y' ): ( (2)^2 - 2(2) - 8 = 4 - 4 - 8 = -8 ). Since the numerator is negative and denominator is positive, ( y' ) is negative in ( (1, 4) ).Second interval: Let's choose ( x = 5 ).Compute numerator: ( 25 - 10 - 8 = 7 ). Positive numerator, so ( y' ) is positive in ( (4, infty) ).Therefore, the function is decreasing on ( (1, 4) ) and increasing on ( (4, infty) ). So, the critical point at ( x = 4 ) is a local minimum.Alternatively, I could compute the second derivative. Let me try that as well to confirm.First, the first derivative is ( y' = frac{x^2 - 2x - 8}{(x - 1)^2} ).To find the second derivative, I can use the quotient rule again. Let me denote ( u = x^2 - 2x - 8 ) and ( v = (x - 1)^2 ).Compute ( u' = 2x - 2 ).Compute ( v' = 2(x - 1) ).Applying the quotient rule:( y'' = frac{u'v - uv'}{v^2} ).So,( y'' = frac{(2x - 2)(x - 1)^2 - (x^2 - 2x - 8)(2(x - 1))}{(x - 1)^4} ).This looks a bit complicated, but let's try to simplify the numerator.First, factor out common terms. Notice that both terms in the numerator have a factor of ( (x - 1) ).Factor out ( (x - 1) ):Numerator becomes:( (x - 1)[(2x - 2)(x - 1) - 2(x^2 - 2x - 8)] ).Let me compute each part inside the brackets.First, compute ( (2x - 2)(x - 1) ):Multiply out:( 2x(x - 1) - 2(x - 1) = 2x^2 - 2x - 2x + 2 = 2x^2 - 4x + 2 ).Next, compute ( 2(x^2 - 2x - 8) ):( 2x^2 - 4x - 16 ).Now, subtract the second expression from the first:( (2x^2 - 4x + 2) - (2x^2 - 4x - 16) ).Distribute the negative sign:( 2x^2 - 4x + 2 - 2x^2 + 4x + 16 ).Combine like terms:( (2x^2 - 2x^2) + (-4x + 4x) + (2 + 16) = 0 + 0 + 18 = 18 ).So, the numerator simplifies to ( (x - 1)(18) = 18(x - 1) ).Therefore, the second derivative is:( y'' = frac{18(x - 1)}{(x - 1)^4} = frac{18}{(x - 1)^3} ).Simplify further:( y'' = frac{18}{(x - 1)^3} ).Now, evaluate ( y'' ) at ( x = 4 ):( y''(4) = frac{18}{(4 - 1)^3} = frac{18}{27} = frac{2}{3} ).Since ( y''(4) > 0 ), the function is concave upward at this point, confirming that it's a local minimum.Therefore, the extremum at ( x = 4 ) is a local minimum. Now, let's find the value of ( y ) at ( x = 4 ):( y(4) = frac{4^2 + 8}{4 - 1} = frac{16 + 8}{3} = frac{24}{3} = 8 ).So, the function has a local minimum at ( x = 4 ) with value 8.Wait, just to make sure, let me compute ( y(4) ) again:Numerator: ( 4^2 + 8 = 16 + 8 = 24 ).Denominator: ( 4 - 1 = 3 ).24 divided by 3 is indeed 8. Correct.Also, just to be thorough, let me check the behavior of the function as ( x ) approaches 1 from the right and as ( x ) approaches infinity.As ( x ) approaches 1 from the right, the denominator approaches 0, and the numerator approaches ( 1 + 8 = 9 ). So, ( y ) approaches ( +infty ).As ( x ) approaches infinity, let's analyze the function:( y = frac{x^2 + 8}{x - 1} ). Divide numerator and denominator by ( x ):( y = frac{x + 8/x}{1 - 1/x} ). As ( x ) approaches infinity, ( 8/x ) and ( 1/x ) approach 0, so ( y ) approaches ( x / 1 = x ), which goes to infinity. So, as ( x ) approaches infinity, ( y ) also approaches infinity.Therefore, the function tends to infinity at both ends of the domain, so the local minimum at ( x = 4 ) is indeed the global minimum on ( x > 1 ).So, summarizing both problems:1. The minimum value of ( y = x + frac{4}{x+1} + 6 ) for ( x > -1 ) is 9 at ( x = 1 ).2. The function ( y = frac{x^2 + 8}{x - 1} ) for ( x > 1 ) has a local (and global) minimum at ( x = 4 ) with value 8.I think that's all. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods (first derivative test and second derivative test) agree on the nature of the critical points. So, I'm confident in these results.**Final Answer**(1) The minimum value is boxed{9}.(2) The extremum is a minimum with value boxed{8}."},{"question":"Let f(x) = (x+2)^2-5.

The general form of a quadratic function is ( f(x) = a(x - h)^2 + k ), where ((h, k)) is the vertex of the parabola. In this case, the function can be rewritten as ( f(x) = (x + 2)^2 - 5 ), which simplifies to ( f(x) = (x - (-2))^2 - 5 ). This shows that the vertex of the parabola is at ((-2, -5)).Since the coefficient of the squared term is positive, the parabola opens upwards. This means the function has a minimum value at the vertex. For a function to have an inverse, it must be one-to-one, meaning each input corresponds to a unique output. A function is one-to-one if it is either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing over its domain.Given that the parabola opens upwards, the function decreases to the left of the vertex and increases to the right of the vertex. Therefore, to ensure the function is one-to-one, the domain should be restricted to the interval where the function is either entirely increasing or entirely decreasing.To make ( f(x) ) one-to-one, the domain should be restricted to the interval where the function is increasing. Since the vertex is at ( x = -2 ), the function starts increasing from this point onwards. Thus, the smallest value of ( c ) that ensures ( f(x) ) is one-to-one and has an inverse is ( c = -2 )."},{"question":"A box contains gold coins.

Starting with the first equation:- For k = 0: N = 4- For k = 1: N = 10- For k = 2: N = 16- For k = 3: N = 22- For k = 4: N = 28- For k = 5: N = 34Now, listing the values from the second equation:- For m = 0: N = 3- For m = 1: N = 8- For m = 2: N = 13- For m = 3: N = 18- For m = 4: N = 23- For m = 5: N = 28The smallest common value of N from both lists is 28. Therefore, the box contains 28 coins.Finally, to find out how many coins are left when these 28 coins are equally divided among seven people, I'll perform the division: 28 √∑ 7 = 4 with a remainder of 0.So, there are 0 coins left when the coins are equally divided among seven people."},{"question":"Given vector overrightarrow{a}=(1, sqrt {3}) and the angle between vector overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{c} is dfrac {pi}{3}, with overrightarrow{a}cdot overrightarrow{c}=2, then the magnitude of overrightarrow{c} equals ______.","answer":"Okay, so I have this vector problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The problem says:Given vector (overrightarrow{a} = (1, sqrt{3})) and the angle between vector (overrightarrow{a}) and (overrightarrow{c}) is (dfrac{pi}{3}), with (overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{c} = 2). Then, we need to find the magnitude of (overrightarrow{c}).Hmm, okay. So, let's recall some vector properties. I remember that the dot product of two vectors can be expressed in two ways: one is the algebraic form, which is the sum of the products of their corresponding components, and the other is the geometric form, which involves the magnitudes of the vectors and the cosine of the angle between them.So, the dot product formula is:[overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{c} = |overrightarrow{a}| |overrightarrow{c}| cos{theta}]Where (|overrightarrow{a}|) is the magnitude of vector (overrightarrow{a}), (|overrightarrow{c}|) is the magnitude of vector (overrightarrow{c}), and (theta) is the angle between them.Given that (overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{c} = 2) and the angle (theta = dfrac{pi}{3}), I can plug these into the formula. But first, I need to find the magnitude of vector (overrightarrow{a}).Calculating (|overrightarrow{a}|):[|overrightarrow{a}| = sqrt{1^2 + (sqrt{3})^2} = sqrt{1 + 3} = sqrt{4} = 2]Okay, so the magnitude of (overrightarrow{a}) is 2. That's straightforward.Now, plugging the known values into the dot product formula:[2 = |overrightarrow{a}| |overrightarrow{c}| cos{left(dfrac{pi}{3}right)}]We know (|overrightarrow{a}| = 2) and (cos{left(dfrac{pi}{3}right)} = dfrac{1}{2}). Let's substitute those in:[2 = 2 times |overrightarrow{c}| times dfrac{1}{2}]Simplify the right side:First, multiply 2 and (dfrac{1}{2}):[2 times dfrac{1}{2} = 1]So, the equation becomes:[2 = 1 times |overrightarrow{c}|]Which simplifies to:[2 = |overrightarrow{c}|]Wait, that seems too straightforward. So, the magnitude of (overrightarrow{c}) is 2? Hmm, let me double-check my steps.1. Calculated (|overrightarrow{a}|): (sqrt{1 + 3} = 2). That seems correct.2. Plugged into the dot product formula: (2 = 2 times |overrightarrow{c}| times dfrac{1}{2}).3. Simplified the right side: (2 times dfrac{1}{2} = 1), so (2 = 1 times |overrightarrow{c}|), which gives (|overrightarrow{c}| = 2).Hmm, seems correct. Maybe I was overcomplicating it. Alternatively, let's think about it another way.If the angle between (overrightarrow{a}) and (overrightarrow{c}) is (dfrac{pi}{3}), and their dot product is 2, which is also equal to (|overrightarrow{a}| |overrightarrow{c}| cos{theta}), so plugging in the known values, we get the magnitude of (overrightarrow{c}) as 2.Alternatively, maybe I can represent (overrightarrow{c}) in terms of components and solve for it. Let's try that approach.Let (overrightarrow{c} = (x, y)). Then, the dot product (overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{c}) is:[1 times x + sqrt{3} times y = x + sqrt{3} y = 2]Also, the angle between (overrightarrow{a}) and (overrightarrow{c}) is (dfrac{pi}{3}), so using the dot product formula:[overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{c} = |overrightarrow{a}| |overrightarrow{c}| cos{theta}]We already know (overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{c} = 2), (|overrightarrow{a}| = 2), (theta = dfrac{pi}{3}), so:[2 = 2 times |overrightarrow{c}| times dfrac{1}{2}]Which simplifies to:[2 = |overrightarrow{c}|]So, same result. So, regardless of the approach, the magnitude of (overrightarrow{c}) is 2.Wait, but let me think again. If I consider the vector (overrightarrow{c}), it has components (x) and (y). We have:1. (x + sqrt{3} y = 2)2. The magnitude of (overrightarrow{c}) is (sqrt{x^2 + y^2}), which we found to be 2.So, can we solve for (x) and (y)?Let me try that. Let me set up the equations:Equation 1: (x + sqrt{3} y = 2)Equation 2: (x^2 + y^2 = (2)^2 = 4)So, let's solve these two equations.From Equation 1: (x = 2 - sqrt{3} y)Substitute into Equation 2:[(2 - sqrt{3} y)^2 + y^2 = 4]Expanding the first term:[(4 - 4 sqrt{3} y + 3 y^2) + y^2 = 4]Combine like terms:[4 - 4 sqrt{3} y + 3 y^2 + y^2 = 4][4 - 4 sqrt{3} y + 4 y^2 = 4]Subtract 4 from both sides:[-4 sqrt{3} y + 4 y^2 = 0]Factor out 4 y:[4 y (- sqrt{3} + y) = 0]So, either (4 y = 0) or (- sqrt{3} + y = 0).Case 1: (4 y = 0) implies (y = 0). Then, from Equation 1: (x = 2 - sqrt{3} times 0 = 2). So, (overrightarrow{c} = (2, 0)). The magnitude is (sqrt{2^2 + 0^2} = 2), which matches our previous result.Case 2: (- sqrt{3} + y = 0) implies (y = sqrt{3}). Then, from Equation 1: (x = 2 - sqrt{3} times sqrt{3} = 2 - 3 = -1). So, (overrightarrow{c} = (-1, sqrt{3})). The magnitude is (sqrt{(-1)^2 + (sqrt{3})^2} = sqrt{1 + 3} = 2), which also matches.So, both possibilities for (overrightarrow{c}) give the magnitude as 2. Therefore, regardless of the direction, the magnitude is indeed 2.Wait, so is that the only possible magnitude? It seems so, because both cases give the same magnitude. So, regardless of the specific components, the magnitude is fixed by the given dot product and angle.Therefore, the magnitude of (overrightarrow{c}) is 2.Just to recap:1. Calculated (|overrightarrow{a}|) as 2.2. Used the dot product formula involving magnitudes and cosine of the angle to find (|overrightarrow{c}|).3. Cross-verified by expressing (overrightarrow{c}) in components and solving the system of equations, which also led to the same magnitude.So, I think that's solid. The answer is 2.**Final Answer**The magnitude of (overrightarrow{c}) is boxed{2}."},{"question":"During 5 hours, a spider can catch 9 flies.

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that to find the minimum of a function, I can take its derivative, set it equal to zero, and solve for x. Then, check if that point is indeed a minimum, maybe using the second derivative test or something. First, let me write down the function again to make sure I have it right: f(x) = (e^x - 1)^2 + (e^{-x} - 1)^2. Yeah, that looks correct. So, I need to find the critical points by taking the derivative f'(x) and setting it to zero.Let me compute the derivative step by step. The function is a sum of two squared terms, so the derivative will be the sum of the derivatives of each term. Starting with the first term, (e^x - 1)^2. The derivative of this with respect to x is 2(e^x - 1) times the derivative of (e^x - 1), which is e^x. So, that part is 2(e^x - 1)e^x.Now, the second term is (e^{-x} - 1)^2. Similarly, the derivative of this is 2(e^{-x} - 1) times the derivative of (e^{-x} - 1), which is -e^{-x}. So, that part is 2(e^{-x} - 1)(-e^{-x}).Putting it all together, the derivative f'(x) is:f'(x) = 2(e^x - 1)e^x + 2(e^{-x} - 1)(-e^{-x})Let me simplify this expression. First, distribute the terms:For the first part: 2(e^x - 1)e^x = 2e^{2x} - 2e^xFor the second part: 2(e^{-x} - 1)(-e^{-x}) = -2e^{-2x} + 2e^{-x}So, combining these, f'(x) = 2e^{2x} - 2e^x - 2e^{-2x} + 2e^{-x}Hmm, that looks a bit complicated. Maybe I can factor out some terms or rewrite it in a more manageable way. Let me see.I notice that 2e^{2x} - 2e^{-2x} can be factored as 2(e^{2x} - e^{-2x}), and similarly, -2e^x + 2e^{-x} can be factored as -2(e^x - e^{-x}). So, let me write that:f'(x) = 2(e^{2x} - e^{-2x}) - 2(e^x - e^{-x})Hmm, I wonder if I can factor this further. Let me recall that e^{2x} - e^{-2x} is equal to (e^x - e^{-x})(e^x + e^{-x}). So, substituting that in:f'(x) = 2(e^x - e^{-x})(e^x + e^{-x}) - 2(e^x - e^{-x})Now, I can factor out 2(e^x - e^{-x}) from both terms:f'(x) = 2(e^x - e^{-x})[(e^x + e^{-x}) - 1]So, that simplifies the derivative a bit. Now, to find the critical points, I set f'(x) = 0:2(e^x - e^{-x})[(e^x + e^{-x}) - 1] = 0Since 2 is not zero, we can divide both sides by 2:(e^x - e^{-x})[(e^x + e^{-x}) - 1] = 0So, this product equals zero if either factor is zero. Let's consider each case separately.First case: e^x - e^{-x} = 0Let me solve this equation. e^x - e^{-x} = 0 => e^x = e^{-x} => e^{2x} = 1 => 2x = ln(1) => 2x = 0 => x = 0So, x = 0 is a critical point.Second case: (e^x + e^{-x}) - 1 = 0 => e^x + e^{-x} = 1Hmm, let's see. Let me denote y = e^x. Then, e^{-x} = 1/y. So, the equation becomes y + 1/y = 1.Multiplying both sides by y: y^2 + 1 = y => y^2 - y + 1 = 0Now, let's solve this quadratic equation: y = [1 ¬± sqrt(1 - 4)] / 2 = [1 ¬± sqrt(-3)] / 2So, the solutions are complex numbers, which means there are no real solutions for y. Therefore, the second case doesn't give any real critical points.Therefore, the only critical point is at x = 0.Now, I need to determine whether this critical point is a minimum, maximum, or a saddle point. For that, I can use the second derivative test.First, let's compute the second derivative f''(x). But before that, maybe it's easier to analyze the behavior of f'(x) around x = 0.Alternatively, since f(x) is a sum of squares, it's always positive, and since it's smooth, the critical point at x = 0 is likely a minimum. But let's verify.Alternatively, let's compute f''(x). To do that, I can differentiate f'(x):f'(x) = 2e^{2x} - 2e^x - 2e^{-2x} + 2e^{-x}So, f''(x) is the derivative of f'(x):f''(x) = 4e^{2x} - 2e^x + 4e^{-2x} - 2e^{-x}Hmm, let me compute f''(0):f''(0) = 4e^{0} - 2e^{0} + 4e^{0} - 2e^{0} = 4*1 - 2*1 + 4*1 - 2*1 = (4 - 2) + (4 - 2) = 2 + 2 = 4Since f''(0) = 4 > 0, the function is concave upwards at x = 0, which means that x = 0 is indeed a local minimum.Now, since the function f(x) is defined for all real numbers, and as x approaches infinity or negative infinity, let's see what happens to f(x):As x approaches infinity, e^x grows exponentially, so (e^x - 1)^2 ~ e^{2x}, which goes to infinity. Similarly, e^{-x} approaches 0, so (e^{-x} - 1)^2 ~ (0 - 1)^2 = 1. So, f(x) approaches infinity as x approaches infinity.As x approaches negative infinity, e^{-x} grows exponentially, so (e^{-x} - 1)^2 ~ e^{-2x}, which goes to infinity. Meanwhile, e^x approaches 0, so (e^x - 1)^2 ~ (0 - 1)^2 = 1. So, f(x) approaches infinity as x approaches negative infinity.Therefore, since f(x) tends to infinity as x approaches both infinities, and there's only one critical point at x = 0, which is a local minimum, that must be the global minimum.Therefore, the minimum value of f(x) occurs at x = 0. Let's compute f(0):f(0) = (e^0 - 1)^2 + (e^{-0} - 1)^2 = (1 - 1)^2 + (1 - 1)^2 = 0 + 0 = 0Wait, that can't be right. Because if I plug x = 0 into f(x), both terms become (1 - 1)^2, which is zero. So, f(0) = 0. But wait, is that correct?Wait, hold on. Let me double-check. e^0 is 1, so e^0 - 1 is 0, so (0)^2 is 0. Similarly, e^{-0} is 1, so e^{-0} - 1 is 0, so (0)^2 is 0. So, f(0) is indeed 0.But wait, is that possible? Let me think. If I have f(x) = (e^x - 1)^2 + (e^{-x} - 1)^2, is it possible for both terms to be zero at the same time? Because e^x = 1 implies x = 0, and e^{-x} = 1 also implies x = 0. So, yes, at x = 0, both terms are zero, so f(0) = 0.But wait, is 0 the minimum value? Because if I plug in x = 0, I get 0, which is the smallest possible value for a sum of squares. So, yes, 0 is the minimum.Wait, but when I computed f''(0) = 4, which is positive, so it's a local minimum. But since f(x) approaches infinity as x approaches both infinities, it's the global minimum.But wait, let me test another point to make sure. Let's take x = 1:f(1) = (e - 1)^2 + (e^{-1} - 1)^2 ‚âà (2.718 - 1)^2 + (0.368 - 1)^2 ‚âà (1.718)^2 + (-0.632)^2 ‚âà 2.952 + 0.400 ‚âà 3.352Which is greater than 0, so yes, f(1) is larger than f(0). Similarly, x = -1:f(-1) = (e^{-1} - 1)^2 + (e^{1} - 1)^2 ‚âà same as f(1), which is approximately 3.352.So, indeed, f(x) is minimized at x = 0 with f(0) = 0.Wait, but just to be thorough, let me check another point, say x = ln(2):f(ln(2)) = (2 - 1)^2 + (1/2 - 1)^2 = (1)^2 + (-1/2)^2 = 1 + 1/4 = 1.25, which is still greater than 0.Similarly, x = ln(3):f(ln(3)) = (3 - 1)^2 + (1/3 - 1)^2 = (2)^2 + (-2/3)^2 = 4 + 4/9 ‚âà 4.444, which is larger.So, yeah, it seems that f(x) is minimized at x = 0 with value 0.But wait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the derivative or the critical points. Let me go back.I had f'(x) = 2(e^x - 1)e^x + 2(e^{-x} - 1)(-e^{-x})Which simplifies to 2e^{2x} - 2e^x - 2e^{-2x} + 2e^{-x}Then, I factored it as 2(e^x - e^{-x})(e^x + e^{-x} - 1)Wait, let me verify that factoring again.Starting from f'(x) = 2e^{2x} - 2e^x - 2e^{-2x} + 2e^{-x}Group terms:(2e^{2x} - 2e^{-2x}) + (-2e^x + 2e^{-x})Factor out 2 from each group:2(e^{2x} - e^{-2x}) - 2(e^x - e^{-x})Now, e^{2x} - e^{-2x} = (e^x - e^{-x})(e^x + e^{-x})So, substitute that in:2(e^x - e^{-x})(e^x + e^{-x}) - 2(e^x - e^{-x})Factor out 2(e^x - e^{-x}):2(e^x - e^{-x})[(e^x + e^{-x}) - 1]Yes, that's correct.So, setting f'(x) = 0 gives either e^x - e^{-x} = 0 or (e^x + e^{-x}) - 1 = 0.We saw that e^x - e^{-x} = 0 leads to x = 0, and the other equation leads to complex solutions, so only x = 0 is critical.So, that seems correct.Therefore, f(x) has a minimum at x = 0, and f(0) = 0.Wait, but let me think again. Is f(x) always non-negative? Yes, because it's a sum of squares. So, the minimum possible value is 0, which is achieved at x = 0. So, that must be the answer.But just to be absolutely sure, let me consider another approach. Maybe using substitution or symmetry.Let me set t = e^x. Then, since e^{-x} = 1/t, the function becomes:f(x) = (t - 1)^2 + (1/t - 1)^2So, f(t) = (t - 1)^2 + (1/t - 1)^2, where t > 0.Now, let's compute this:(t - 1)^2 = t^2 - 2t + 1(1/t - 1)^2 = (1 - t)^2 / t^2 = (t^2 - 2t + 1)/t^2So, f(t) = t^2 - 2t + 1 + (t^2 - 2t + 1)/t^2Let me write that as:f(t) = t^2 - 2t + 1 + t^{-2} - 2t^{-1} + t^{-0}Wait, t^{-0} is 1, so:f(t) = t^2 - 2t + 1 + t^{-2} - 2t^{-1} + 1Wait, that seems off. Let me compute (1/t - 1)^2 again:(1/t - 1)^2 = (1 - t)^2 / t^2 = (1 - 2t + t^2)/t^2 = 1/t^2 - 2/t + 1So, f(t) = (t^2 - 2t + 1) + (1/t^2 - 2/t + 1) = t^2 - 2t + 1 + 1/t^2 - 2/t + 1Combine like terms:t^2 + 1/t^2 - 2t - 2/t + 2So, f(t) = t^2 + 1/t^2 - 2t - 2/t + 2Hmm, now, maybe I can write this in terms of u = t + 1/t. Let me try that.Let u = t + 1/t. Then, u^2 = t^2 + 2 + 1/t^2, so t^2 + 1/t^2 = u^2 - 2.Similarly, let's see the other terms: -2t - 2/t = -2(t + 1/t) = -2u.So, substituting back into f(t):f(t) = (u^2 - 2) - 2u + 2 = u^2 - 2 - 2u + 2 = u^2 - 2uSo, f(t) = u^2 - 2u, where u = t + 1/t, and since t > 0, u >= 2 by AM >= GM, because t + 1/t >= 2.So, f(t) = u^2 - 2u, and u >= 2.Now, let's find the minimum of f(t) in terms of u.f(u) = u^2 - 2uThis is a quadratic function in u, opening upwards (since the coefficient of u^2 is positive). Its vertex is at u = -b/(2a) = 2/(2*1) = 1.But wait, the domain of u is u >= 2, so the vertex at u = 1 is outside the domain. Therefore, the minimum of f(u) on u >= 2 occurs at u = 2.So, f(u) at u = 2 is 2^2 - 2*2 = 4 - 4 = 0.Therefore, the minimum value of f(t) is 0, achieved when u = 2.But u = t + 1/t = 2, which occurs when t = 1, since t + 1/t = 2 implies t = 1 (because t > 0).Therefore, t = 1, which means e^x = 1, so x = 0.So, this substitution method also confirms that the minimum value is 0 at x = 0.Therefore, I can be confident that the minimum value of f(x) is 0.Just to recap, I approached the problem by taking the derivative, found the critical point at x = 0, verified it's a minimum using the second derivative test, and also confirmed it by substituting t = e^x and reducing the problem to a quadratic in u = t + 1/t, which also showed the minimum occurs at u = 2, corresponding to t = 1 and x = 0.So, all methods point to the same conclusion: the minimum value is 0 at x = 0.**Final Answer**The minimum value of ( f(x) ) is boxed{0}."},{"question":"Given that f(x+1)=x^2-1, find the value of f(4).","answer":"To find the value of ( f(4) ), I start by letting ( x + 1 = 4 ).

It is also known that the vertex of Pi_{1} bisects the segment connecting the origin and the vertex of Pi_{2}. At what abscissa does the parabola Pi_{2} intersect the x-axis again?","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem about two parabolas, Œ†‚ÇÅ and Œ†‚ÇÇ. Both have upward-facing branches, which means their equations are in the form y = ax¬≤ + bx + c, where a is positive. First, Œ†‚ÇÅ passes through the points (10, 0) and (13, 0). Since these are x-intercepts, that tells me that Œ†‚ÇÅ has roots at x = 10 and x = 13. So, I can write Œ†‚ÇÅ in its factored form as y = a‚ÇÅ(x - 10)(x - 13). Next, Œ†‚ÇÇ also passes through (13, 0), so that's one of its x-intercepts. It might have another x-intercept somewhere else, which is what we're trying to find. Let's denote the other x-intercept as (k, 0). So, Œ†‚ÇÇ can be written as y = a‚ÇÇ(x - 13)(x - k). Now, the key piece of information is about the vertices. The vertex of Œ†‚ÇÅ bisects the segment connecting the origin (0,0) and the vertex of Œ†‚ÇÇ. That means the vertex of Œ†‚ÇÅ is the midpoint between (0,0) and the vertex of Œ†‚ÇÇ. Let me recall that the vertex of a parabola in factored form y = a(x - r)(x - s) is located at x = (r + s)/2. So, for Œ†‚ÇÅ, the vertex is at x = (10 + 13)/2 = 23/2 = 11.5. Similarly, for Œ†‚ÇÇ, the vertex is at x = (13 + k)/2. Since the vertex of Œ†‚ÇÅ is the midpoint between the origin and the vertex of Œ†‚ÇÇ, let's denote the vertex of Œ†‚ÇÇ as (h, m). Then, the midpoint between (0,0) and (h, m) is (h/2, m/2). But we also know that the vertex of Œ†‚ÇÅ is at (11.5, something). Wait, hold on, the vertex of Œ†‚ÇÅ is at (11.5, y‚ÇÅ), and this is supposed to be the midpoint between (0,0) and the vertex of Œ†‚ÇÇ, which is (h, m). So, setting up the equations:11.5 = (0 + h)/2  y‚ÇÅ = (0 + m)/2So, from the first equation, h = 23. So, the x-coordinate of the vertex of Œ†‚ÇÇ is 23. But we also know that the vertex of Œ†‚ÇÇ is at x = (13 + k)/2. So, setting that equal to 23:(13 + k)/2 = 23  13 + k = 46  k = 46 - 13  k = 33So, the other x-intercept of Œ†‚ÇÇ is at x = 33. Therefore, the parabola Œ†‚ÇÇ intersects the x-axis again at (33, 0). Wait, let me double-check. If the vertex of Œ†‚ÇÅ is the midpoint between the origin and the vertex of Œ†‚ÇÇ, then the vertex of Œ†‚ÇÇ is twice the vertex of Œ†‚ÇÅ. Since the vertex of Œ†‚ÇÅ is at x = 11.5, then the vertex of Œ†‚ÇÇ should be at x = 23. And since the vertex of Œ†‚ÇÇ is at x = (13 + k)/2, solving for k gives k = 33. So, yes, that seems correct. Just to make sure, let me think about the y-coordinates as well. The vertex of Œ†‚ÇÅ is at (11.5, y‚ÇÅ), and it's the midpoint between (0,0) and (23, m). So, y‚ÇÅ = m/2. But do we need to find m? The problem doesn't ask for the y-coordinate, just the abscissa where Œ†‚ÇÇ intersects the x-axis again, which is 33. So, I think that's the answer. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. The key was recognizing that the vertex of Œ†‚ÇÅ is the midpoint, so we can find the vertex of Œ†‚ÇÇ, and then use that to find the other root. **Final Answer**The parabola Œ†‚ÇÇ intersects the x-axis again at the abscissa boxed{33}."},{"question":"A school conducted a vision survey among its 1,600 male and female students, using stratified sampling to draw a sample of 200. It is known that 10 fewer girls than boys were sampled. The number of female students in the school is __________.","answer":"To determine the number of female students in the school, I'll start by defining variables for the number of boys and girls sampled. Let ( b ) represent the number of boys and ( g ) represent the number of girls in the sample. According to the problem, the total sample size is 200, so I can write the equation:[ b + g = 200 ]It's also given that there are 10 fewer girls than boys in the sample. This relationship can be expressed as:[ g = b - 10 ]Substituting the second equation into the first equation, I get:[ b + (b - 10) = 200 ][ 2b - 10 = 200 ][ 2b = 210 ][ b = 105 ]Now that I know there are 105 boys in the sample, I can find the number of girls:[ g = 105 - 10 = 95 ]The school has a total of 1,600 students. To find the proportion of girls in the school, I'll use the ratio from the sample:[ text{Proportion of girls} = frac{95}{200} = 0.475 ]Finally, applying this proportion to the total number of students gives the number of female students:[ text{Number of female students} = 0.475 times 1600 = 760 ]"},{"question":"Given that the arc length of a sector is 6cm, and its area is 18cm^{2}, what is the measure of the sector's central angle in radians?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here about a sector of a circle. The arc length is 6 cm, and the area is 18 cm¬≤. I need to find the measure of the central angle in radians. Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that for a sector of a circle, there are some standard formulas. I think the arc length (which is the length of the curved part of the sector) is given by the formula ( s = rtheta ), where ( r ) is the radius and ( theta ) is the central angle in radians. And the area of the sector is given by ( A = frac{1}{2}r^2theta ). So, I have two equations here:1. ( s = rtheta )2. ( A = frac{1}{2}r^2theta )Given in the problem, the arc length ( s = 6 ) cm, and the area ( A = 18 ) cm¬≤. So, I can plug these values into the equations:1. ( 6 = rtheta )2. ( 18 = frac{1}{2}r^2theta )Now, I have two equations with two unknowns, ( r ) and ( theta ). I need to solve this system of equations to find ( theta ).Let me write down the equations again:1. ( 6 = rtheta )  --> Equation (1)2. ( 18 = frac{1}{2}r^2theta )  --> Equation (2)I can solve Equation (1) for one of the variables and substitute into Equation (2). Let me solve Equation (1) for ( r ):From Equation (1): ( r = frac{6}{theta} )Now, substitute this expression for ( r ) into Equation (2):( 18 = frac{1}{2} times left( frac{6}{theta} right)^2 times theta )Let me simplify this step by step.First, square ( frac{6}{theta} ):( left( frac{6}{theta} right)^2 = frac{36}{theta^2} )So, plug that back into the equation:( 18 = frac{1}{2} times frac{36}{theta^2} times theta )Simplify the multiplication:First, multiply ( frac{1}{2} ) and ( frac{36}{theta^2} ):( frac{1}{2} times frac{36}{theta^2} = frac{18}{theta^2} )Now, multiply that by ( theta ):( frac{18}{theta^2} times theta = frac{18}{theta} )So, the equation becomes:( 18 = frac{18}{theta} )Hmm, okay, so now I have:( 18 = frac{18}{theta} )I can solve for ( theta ) by multiplying both sides by ( theta ):( 18theta = 18 )Then, divide both sides by 18:( theta = 1 )So, the central angle ( theta ) is 1 radian.Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.Starting from Equation (1): ( 6 = rtheta ) so ( r = 6/theta ).Substituted into Equation (2): ( 18 = (1/2)(6/theta)^2 theta ).Calculating ( (6/theta)^2 = 36/theta^2 ), so ( (1/2)(36/theta^2) = 18/theta^2 ).Then, multiplying by ( theta ) gives ( 18/theta ).So, ( 18 = 18/theta ) --> ( theta = 1 ). That seems correct.Alternatively, maybe I can check by plugging back into the original equations.If ( theta = 1 ), then from Equation (1): ( r = 6/1 = 6 ) cm.Then, check Equation (2): Area should be ( (1/2)(6)^2(1) = (1/2)(36)(1) = 18 ) cm¬≤. Yep, that matches.So, everything checks out. The central angle is 1 radian.I think that's the answer. It seems straightforward once I set up the two equations and solve for the variables. I didn't make any calculation errors that I can see, and the check confirms it.**Final Answer**The measure of the sector's central angle is boxed{1} radian."},{"question":"Let[mathbf{A} = begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0  0 & 0 & -1  0 & 1 & 0 end{pmatrix}.]Compute mathbf{A}^{95}.","answer":"Okay, so I have this matrix A, and I need to compute A raised to the 95th power. Hmm, let me write down the matrix first to get a clear picture.Matrix A is:[mathbf{A} = begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0  0 & 0 & -1  0 & 1 & 0 end{pmatrix}]Alright, it's a 3x3 matrix. The first row is all zeros, which might be helpful because multiplying by a zero row can simplify things. The other two rows seem to form a 2x2 rotation matrix or something similar. Let me check that.Looking at the submatrix in the lower right corner:[begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1  1 & 0 end{pmatrix}]Yes, that looks familiar. I think this is a rotation matrix. Specifically, it's a 90-degree rotation matrix. Let me recall, a rotation matrix for 90 degrees is:[begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1  1 & 0 end{pmatrix}]Which is exactly what we have here. So, this submatrix is a rotation by 90 degrees. That might be useful because powers of rotation matrices correspond to multiple rotations. For example, rotating 90 degrees four times brings you back to the starting position, so the fourth power would be the identity matrix.But wait, our matrix A isn't just that 2x2 submatrix; it's a 3x3 matrix with an extra row and column of zeros. So, how does that affect things? Let me think. When we multiply matrices, the zero rows and columns might cause some simplifications in the multiplication.Let me try computing the first few powers of A to see if there's a pattern.First, A^1 is just A:[mathbf{A}^1 = begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0  0 & 0 & -1  0 & 1 & 0 end{pmatrix}]Now, let's compute A^2. To do this, I'll multiply A by itself.Multiplying A by A:First row of A is [0, 0, 0], so when we multiply by any column, it will result in 0. So, the first row of A^2 will be [0, 0, 0].For the second row of A^2, we take the second row of A and multiply by each column of A.Second row of A is [0, 0, -1]. Let's compute each element:- First element: 0*0 + 0*0 + (-1)*0 = 0- Second element: 0*0 + 0*0 + (-1)*1 = -1- Third element: 0*0 + 0*(-1) + (-1)*0 = 0So, the second row of A^2 is [0, -1, 0].Similarly, for the third row of A^2, we take the third row of A, which is [0, 1, 0], and multiply by each column of A.- First element: 0*0 + 1*0 + 0*0 = 0- Second element: 0*0 + 1*0 + 0*1 = 0- Third element: 0*0 + 1*(-1) + 0*0 = -1So, the third row of A^2 is [0, 0, -1].Putting it all together, A^2 is:[mathbf{A}^2 = begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0  0 & -1 & 0  0 & 0 & -1 end{pmatrix}]Wait, that's interesting. The diagonal elements in the lower right are -1. So, A squared is a diagonal matrix with 0, -1, -1 on the diagonal.Let me compute A^3 now. That would be A^2 multiplied by A.Again, the first row of A^2 is [0, 0, 0], so multiplying by any column will give 0. So, the first row of A^3 is [0, 0, 0].For the second row of A^3, we take the second row of A^2, which is [0, -1, 0], and multiply by each column of A.- First element: 0*0 + (-1)*0 + 0*0 = 0- Second element: 0*0 + (-1)*0 + 0*1 = 0- Third element: 0*0 + (-1)*(-1) + 0*0 = 1So, the second row of A^3 is [0, 0, 1].For the third row of A^3, we take the third row of A^2, which is [0, 0, -1], and multiply by each column of A.- First element: 0*0 + 0*0 + (-1)*0 = 0- Second element: 0*0 + 0*0 + (-1)*1 = -1- Third element: 0*0 + 0*(-1) + (-1)*0 = 0So, the third row of A^3 is [0, -1, 0].Putting it together, A^3 is:[mathbf{A}^3 = begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0  0 & 0 & 1  0 & -1 & 0 end{pmatrix}]Hmm, that looks similar to the original matrix A but with some sign changes. Let me compare:Original A:[begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0  0 & 0 & -1  0 & 1 & 0 end{pmatrix}]A^3:[begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0  0 & 0 & 1  0 & -1 & 0 end{pmatrix}]Yes, it's like A with the signs flipped in the non-zero entries. So, A^3 is -A.Wait, let me check:If A^3 = -A, then A^4 would be A^3 * A = (-A) * A = -A^2.But let's compute A^4 to confirm.Compute A^4 = A^3 * A.First row is [0, 0, 0].Second row of A^3 is [0, 0, 1]. Multiply by A:- First element: 0*0 + 0*0 + 1*0 = 0- Second element: 0*0 + 0*0 + 1*1 = 1- Third element: 0*0 + 0*(-1) + 1*0 = 0So, second row is [0, 1, 0].Third row of A^3 is [0, -1, 0]. Multiply by A:- First element: 0*0 + (-1)*0 + 0*0 = 0- Second element: 0*0 + (-1)*0 + 0*1 = 0- Third element: 0*0 + (-1)*(-1) + 0*0 = 1So, third row is [0, 0, 1].Thus, A^4 is:[mathbf{A}^4 = begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0  0 & 1 & 0  0 & 0 & 1 end{pmatrix}]Which is the identity matrix for the lower right 2x2 block, and zeros elsewhere. So, A^4 is the identity matrix except for the first row and column, which are zeros. Wait, actually, no. The identity matrix has ones on the diagonal. But in our case, A^4 has 1s in the (2,2) and (3,3) positions, but the (1,1) is still 0. So, it's not the full identity matrix, but it's a diagonal matrix with 0, 1, 1 on the diagonal.Wait, so A^4 is:[begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0  0 & 1 & 0  0 & 0 & 1 end{pmatrix}]Which is a projection matrix onto the last two coordinates, essentially. Interesting.So, let me note the pattern so far:A^1:[begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0  0 & 0 & -1  0 & 1 & 0 end{pmatrix}]A^2:[begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0  0 & -1 & 0  0 & 0 & -1 end{pmatrix}]A^3:[begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0  0 & 0 & 1  0 & -1 & 0 end{pmatrix}]A^4:[begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0  0 & 1 & 0  0 & 0 & 1 end{pmatrix}]So, A^4 is a diagonal matrix with 0, 1, 1. Hmm, so if I compute A^5, that would be A^4 * A.Let's compute A^5:First row is [0, 0, 0].Second row of A^4 is [0, 1, 0]. Multiply by A:- First element: 0*0 + 1*0 + 0*0 = 0- Second element: 0*0 + 1*0 + 0*1 = 0- Third element: 0*0 + 1*(-1) + 0*0 = -1So, second row is [0, 0, -1].Third row of A^4 is [0, 0, 1]. Multiply by A:- First element: 0*0 + 0*0 + 1*0 = 0- Second element: 0*0 + 0*0 + 1*1 = 1- Third element: 0*0 + 0*(-1) + 1*0 = 0So, third row is [0, 1, 0].Putting it together, A^5 is:[begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0  0 & 0 & -1  0 & 1 & 0 end{pmatrix}]Wait, that's the same as A^1. So, A^5 = A.So, this implies that the powers of A cycle every 4 steps. Because A^5 = A, so A^6 = A^2, A^7 = A^3, A^8 = A^4, A^9 = A^5 = A, and so on.Therefore, the cycle length is 4. So, the powers of A repeat every 4 exponents. So, to compute A^95, we can find the remainder when 95 is divided by 4, and then use that to determine which matrix in the cycle A^95 corresponds to.Let me compute 95 divided by 4.4*23 = 92, so 95 - 92 = 3. So, 95 = 4*23 + 3. Therefore, the remainder is 3.So, A^95 corresponds to A^(4*23 + 3) = (A^4)^23 * A^3. But since A^4 is a diagonal matrix, raising it to the 23rd power is just raising each diagonal element to the 23rd power.But wait, A^4 is:[begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0  0 & 1 & 0  0 & 0 & 1 end{pmatrix}]So, (A^4)^23 is:[begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0  0 & 1^{23} & 0  0 & 0 & 1^{23} end{pmatrix} = begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0  0 & 1 & 0  0 & 0 & 1 end{pmatrix}]Which is the same as A^4. So, (A^4)^23 = A^4.Therefore, A^95 = A^4 * A^3.But let's compute A^4 * A^3.A^4 is:[begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0  0 & 1 & 0  0 & 0 & 1 end{pmatrix}]A^3 is:[begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0  0 & 0 & 1  0 & -1 & 0 end{pmatrix}]Multiplying A^4 (which is diagonal) by A^3 is the same as scaling each row of A^3 by the corresponding diagonal element of A^4.But since the first row of A^4 is [0, 0, 0], multiplying A^4 by A^3 will zero out the first row of A^3.Wait, actually, no. Matrix multiplication is not element-wise multiplication. Let me correct that.Wait, no, actually, when you multiply A^4 (which is diagonal) by A^3, it's equivalent to scaling the columns of A^3 by the diagonal elements of A^4.Wait, no, actually, matrix multiplication is rows of the first matrix times columns of the second matrix.So, let me compute A^4 * A^3:First row of A^4 is [0, 0, 0]. So, multiplying by any column of A^3 will give 0. So, the first row of the product is [0, 0, 0].Second row of A^4 is [0, 1, 0]. Multiply by each column of A^3.- First element: 0*0 + 1*0 + 0*0 = 0- Second element: 0*0 + 1*0 + 0*(-1) = 0- Third element: 0*0 + 1*1 + 0*0 = 1Wait, hold on, that doesn't seem right. Let me write it out step by step.Wait, no, actually, the second row of A^4 is [0, 1, 0], and we need to multiply it by each column of A^3.But A^3 is:[begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0  0 & 0 & 1  0 & -1 & 0 end{pmatrix}]So, columns of A^3 are:First column: [0, 0, 0]^TSecond column: [0, 0, -1]^TThird column: [0, 1, 0]^TSo, multiplying second row of A^4 [0, 1, 0] with first column [0, 0, 0]^T: 0*0 + 1*0 + 0*0 = 0Second element: [0, 1, 0] * [0, 0, -1]^T = 0*0 + 1*0 + 0*(-1) = 0Third element: [0, 1, 0] * [0, 1, 0]^T = 0*0 + 1*1 + 0*0 = 1So, second row of the product is [0, 0, 1].Third row of A^4 is [0, 0, 1]. Multiply by each column of A^3.First element: 0*0 + 0*0 + 1*0 = 0Second element: 0*0 + 0*0 + 1*(-1) = -1Third element: 0*0 + 0*1 + 1*0 = 0So, third row of the product is [0, -1, 0].Putting it all together, A^4 * A^3 is:[begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0  0 & 0 & 1  0 & -1 & 0 end{pmatrix}]Which is exactly A^3. So, A^4 * A^3 = A^3.Therefore, A^95 = A^4 * A^3 = A^3.But wait, earlier I thought that A^95 would be A^(4*23 + 3) = (A^4)^23 * A^3, which is A^4 * A^3, which is A^3. So, yes, that's consistent.Therefore, A^95 is equal to A^3, which we computed earlier as:[begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0  0 & 0 & 1  0 & -1 & 0 end{pmatrix}]Alternatively, since A^3 = -A, as I noticed earlier, because A^3 is:[begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0  0 & 0 & 1  0 & -1 & 0 end{pmatrix}]And A is:[begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0  0 & 0 & -1  0 & 1 & 0 end{pmatrix}]So, A^3 is indeed -A because if you multiply A by -1, you get:[begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0  0 & 0 & 1  0 & -1 & 0 end{pmatrix}]Which is exactly A^3.Therefore, A^3 = -A, so A^95 = A^3 = -A.So, to write out A^95, it's just -A:[mathbf{A}^{95} = -mathbf{A} = begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0  0 & 0 & 1  0 & -1 & 0 end{pmatrix}]Alternatively, I can write it as:[begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0  0 & 0 & 1  0 & -1 & 0 end{pmatrix}]Which is the same as A^3.Let me double-check my reasoning. Since A^4 is a diagonal matrix with 0, 1, 1 on the diagonal, and when we multiply A^4 by A^3, we get A^3 back because the first row remains zero, and the other rows are scaled by 1, which doesn't change them. So, that makes sense.Also, since the cycle is every 4 exponents, and 95 mod 4 is 3, so A^95 is the same as A^3, which is -A. So, that seems consistent.Therefore, I think I can confidently say that A^95 is equal to -A, which is the matrix:[begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0  0 & 0 & 1  0 & -1 & 0 end{pmatrix}]**Final Answer**boxed{begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0  0 & 0 & 1  0 & -1 & 0 end{pmatrix}}"},{"question":"Cristian has 50 more black cookies in his cookie jar than white cookies.

I need to calculate two things: first, the probability that the athlete breaks at least 3 world records, and second, the mathematical expectation or mean of the number of world records broken.Hmm, let me think. This seems like a probability problem involving multiple trials with the same probability of success each time. That makes me think of the binomial distribution. Yeah, because each competition is an independent trial with two outcomes: success (breaking the record) or failure (not breaking it). So, the number of world records broken, let's call it Œæ, follows a binomial distribution with parameters n=5 and p=0.8.For the first part, I need the probability that the athlete breaks at least 3 world records. That means I need P(Œæ ‚â• 3). Since the binomial distribution is discrete, this is the sum of probabilities from Œæ=3 to Œæ=5. So, P(Œæ=3) + P(Œæ=4) + P(Œæ=5).The formula for the binomial probability is P(Œæ=k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k), where C(n, k) is the combination of n things taken k at a time.So, let me compute each term:1. P(Œæ=3): C(5,3) * (0.8)^3 * (0.2)^22. P(Œæ=4): C(5,4) * (0.8)^4 * (0.2)^13. P(Œæ=5): C(5,5) * (0.8)^5 * (0.2)^0Let me calculate each one step by step.Starting with P(Œæ=3):C(5,3) is the number of combinations of 5 things taken 3 at a time. I remember that C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!).So, C(5,3) = 5! / (3! * 2!) = (5*4*3!)/(3! * 2!) = (5*4)/2! = 20/2 = 10.Then, (0.8)^3 is 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8. Let me compute that:0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64, then 0.64 * 0.8 = 0.512.(0.2)^2 is 0.2 * 0.2 = 0.04.So, P(Œæ=3) = 10 * 0.512 * 0.04.Let me compute 10 * 0.512 first: that's 5.12. Then, 5.12 * 0.04 is 0.2048.Okay, so P(Œæ=3) is 0.2048.Next, P(Œæ=4):C(5,4) is 5! / (4! * 1!) = (5*4!)/(4! * 1) = 5/1 = 5.(0.8)^4: Let's compute that. 0.8^2 is 0.64, so 0.64 * 0.64 = 0.4096. Wait, no, that's 0.8^4? Wait, 0.8^3 is 0.512, so 0.512 * 0.8 = 0.4096. Yeah, that's correct.(0.2)^1 is just 0.2.So, P(Œæ=4) = 5 * 0.4096 * 0.2.First, 5 * 0.4096 is 2.048. Then, 2.048 * 0.2 is 0.4096.So, P(Œæ=4) is 0.4096.Now, P(Œæ=5):C(5,5) is 1, since there's only one way to choose all 5.(0.8)^5: Let's compute that. 0.8^2 is 0.64, 0.64 * 0.64 is 0.4096, then 0.4096 * 0.8 is 0.32768.(0.2)^0 is 1.So, P(Œæ=5) = 1 * 0.32768 * 1 = 0.32768.Now, adding all these up: P(Œæ=3) + P(Œæ=4) + P(Œæ=5) = 0.2048 + 0.4096 + 0.32768.Let me add them step by step.First, 0.2048 + 0.4096: 0.2048 + 0.4096 is 0.6144.Then, 0.6144 + 0.32768: Let's see, 0.6144 + 0.3 is 0.9144, then +0.02768 is 0.94208.So, the total probability is 0.94208.Hmm, that seems high, but considering that the probability of success is 0.8, which is quite high, it's plausible that breaking at least 3 records is quite likely.Wait, let me double-check my calculations in case I made a mistake.First, P(Œæ=3):C(5,3)=10, (0.8)^3=0.512, (0.2)^2=0.04. So, 10 * 0.512=5.12, 5.12 * 0.04=0.2048. That seems correct.P(Œæ=4):C(5,4)=5, (0.8)^4=0.4096, (0.2)^1=0.2. So, 5 * 0.4096=2.048, 2.048 * 0.2=0.4096. Correct.P(Œæ=5):C(5,5)=1, (0.8)^5=0.32768, (0.2)^0=1. So, 1 * 0.32768=0.32768. Correct.Adding them up: 0.2048 + 0.4096 is 0.6144, plus 0.32768 is 0.94208. So, 0.94208 is the probability of breaking at least 3 records.So, that's part (1) done.Now, part (2) asks for the mathematical expectation EŒæ, which is the mean of the number of world records broken.I remember that for a binomial distribution, the expectation is n * p.So, since n=5 and p=0.8, EŒæ = 5 * 0.8 = 4.Wait, that seems straightforward. So, the expectation is 4.But just to make sure, let me recall the formula for expectation in a binomial distribution.Yes, it's indeed n * p, because each trial contributes an expected value of p, and there are n trials.So, 5 * 0.8 is 4. So, EŒæ = 4.Alternatively, if I were to compute it manually, the expectation is the sum over k=0 to 5 of k * P(Œæ=k).But since we know it's a binomial distribution, it's easier to use the formula.But just to be thorough, let me compute it manually as well.Compute EŒæ = Œ£ [k * P(Œæ=k)] from k=0 to 5.We already have P(Œæ=3)=0.2048, P(Œæ=4)=0.4096, P(Œæ=5)=0.32768.We need P(Œæ=0), P(Œæ=1), P(Œæ=2) as well.Let me compute them.P(Œæ=0): C(5,0)*(0.8)^0*(0.2)^5.C(5,0)=1, (0.8)^0=1, (0.2)^5=0.00032.So, P(Œæ=0)=1*1*0.00032=0.00032.P(Œæ=1): C(5,1)*(0.8)^1*(0.2)^4.C(5,1)=5, (0.8)^1=0.8, (0.2)^4=0.0016.So, P(Œæ=1)=5*0.8*0.0016=5*0.00128=0.0064.P(Œæ=2): C(5,2)*(0.8)^2*(0.2)^3.C(5,2)=10, (0.8)^2=0.64, (0.2)^3=0.008.So, P(Œæ=2)=10*0.64*0.008=10*0.00512=0.0512.So, now, let's list all the probabilities:Œæ | P(Œæ)0 | 0.000321 | 0.00642 | 0.05123 | 0.20484 | 0.40965 | 0.32768Now, let's compute EŒæ = 0*0.00032 + 1*0.0064 + 2*0.0512 + 3*0.2048 + 4*0.4096 + 5*0.32768.Compute each term:0*0.00032 = 01*0.0064 = 0.00642*0.0512 = 0.10243*0.2048 = 0.61444*0.4096 = 1.63845*0.32768 = 1.6384Now, sum all these up:0 + 0.0064 = 0.00640.0064 + 0.1024 = 0.10880.1088 + 0.6144 = 0.72320.7232 + 1.6384 = 2.36162.3616 + 1.6384 = 4.0So, EŒæ = 4.0, which matches the formula n*p=5*0.8=4.Therefore, both methods give the same result, so I can be confident that the expectation is indeed 4.So, summarizing:1) The probability of breaking at least 3 world records is 0.94208.2) The expectation is 4.But let me just write the probabilities with more decimal places to ensure accuracy.Wait, 0.94208 is already precise to five decimal places. Alternatively, as a fraction, but since the question doesn't specify, decimal is fine.Alternatively, we can write it as a fraction. Let me see:0.94208 is equal to 94208/100000. Let's simplify that.Divide numerator and denominator by 16: 94208 √∑16=5888, 100000 √∑16=6250.5888/6250. Let me see if it can be reduced further.Divide numerator and denominator by 2: 2944/3125.2944 √∑ 2 =1472, 3125 √∑2=1562.5, which is not integer, so 2944/3125 is the simplified fraction.But 2944 divided by 3125 is 0.94208, so that's correct.Alternatively, if we want, we can write it as 2944/3125, but decimal is probably acceptable.So, to recap:1) The probability is 0.94208.2) The expectation is 4.I think that's all.**Final Answer**(1) The probability is boxed{0.94208}.(2) The mathematical expectation is boxed{4}."},{"question":"Find the smallest number in which all digits are different and the sum of all digits equals 32.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem: find the smallest number where all digits are different, and the sum of all digits equals 32. Hmm, okay. Let me try to figure this out step by step.First, I need to understand the problem correctly. I have to find a number where each digit is unique, meaning no repeating digits, and when I add up all the digits, the total is 32. Also, among all such numbers, I need the smallest one. So, it's about minimizing the number, which usually means having fewer digits and arranging them in ascending order.Let me start by thinking about how many digits this number can have. The maximum sum of digits for a number with n digits is 9 + 8 + 7 + ... + (10 - n). Wait, actually, it's the sum of the first n digits starting from 9 and going downwards. So, for example, a 1-digit number can have a maximum of 9, a 2-digit number can have a maximum of 17 (9+8), a 3-digit number can have 24 (9+8+7), and so on.Let me calculate the maximum sum for different digit lengths:- 1 digit: 9- 2 digits: 9 + 8 = 17- 3 digits: 9 + 8 + 7 = 24- 4 digits: 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 = 30- 5 digits: 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 = 35Okay, so the maximum sum for a 4-digit number is 30, which is less than 32. For a 5-digit number, the maximum sum is 35, which is more than 32. So, the number must have 5 digits because 4 digits can't reach 32, and 5 digits can.Now, since we need the smallest number, we want the number to have as few digits as possible, but since 5 digits are necessary, we have to work with that. So, the number will be a 5-digit number with all unique digits, and the sum of digits is 32.To get the smallest number, we should arrange the digits in ascending order. So, the leftmost digit should be as small as possible, then the next, and so on. But we also have to make sure that the sum of all digits is 32.So, let's think about how to choose 5 unique digits that add up to 32. Since we want the smallest number, we should aim for the smallest possible digits on the left. So, starting from the smallest digit (0), but wait, the first digit can't be 0 because then it wouldn't be a 5-digit number. So, the first digit has to be at least 1.Let me try to construct such a number.First, let's list the digits from 0 to 9: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.We need to pick 5 unique digits from these, with the sum of 32, and arrange them in ascending order to get the smallest number.To get the smallest number, we want the digits to be as small as possible, starting from the left. So, let's try starting with the smallest possible digits and see if we can reach the sum of 32.Let me think about the maximum sum we can get with 5 digits. As I calculated earlier, it's 35 (9+8+7+6+5). So, 32 is 3 less than 35. So, maybe we can subtract 3 from the maximum digits.But wait, we need to subtract 3 in such a way that the digits remain unique and as small as possible. Hmm, perhaps not the best approach.Alternatively, let's try to find digits starting from the smallest.Let me think: the smallest 5 digits are 0,1,2,3,4. Their sum is 0+1+2+3+4=10. That's way too low. We need 32, so we need much larger digits.Wait, perhaps I should think about the digits in reverse. Since the maximum sum is 35, and we need 32, which is 3 less. So, maybe we can take the maximum digits (9,8,7,6,5) which sum to 35, and then reduce the sum by 3 by replacing some digits with smaller ones.But we have to ensure that the digits are still unique and that the resulting number is the smallest possible.So, starting with 9,8,7,6,5. Let's see:If I replace the smallest digit (5) with a smaller digit, but 5 is already the smallest in that set. So, replacing 5 with a smaller digit would require removing 5 and adding a digit less than 5. But we need to keep the digits unique.Wait, but 5 is already the smallest, so replacing it with a smaller digit would mean using a digit not already in the set. Let's see:If I replace 5 with 2, for example, the digits would be 9,8,7,6,2. The sum is 9+8+7+6+2=32. Okay, that works. So, the digits are 2,6,7,8,9. Arranged in ascending order, that's 2,6,7,8,9, so the number is 26789.But wait, is that the smallest possible? Let me check if there's a smaller number.Alternatively, maybe we can have a smaller digit in the higher places. For example, can we have a number starting with 1?If the first digit is 1, then the remaining four digits need to sum to 31 (since 32 -1=31). Let's see if that's possible.So, we need four unique digits that sum to 31, and all digits must be greater than or equal to 0, but since we already used 1, the other digits can't be 1.Wait, actually, no, digits can be anything except 1 because we already used 1. Wait, no, actually, in the number, digits can be anything except repeating. So, if we use 1 as the first digit, the remaining digits can include 0, but they have to be unique.Wait, but 0 can be used in the other digits, but not in the first digit. So, if we have 1 as the first digit, the remaining four digits can include 0, but they have to be unique and sum to 31.But let's see: the maximum sum of four unique digits (including 0) is 9+8+7+6=30. Wait, 30 is less than 31. So, it's impossible to have four digits summing to 31 if the first digit is 1. Therefore, the first digit cannot be 1.So, the first digit has to be at least 2.Wait, let me check that again. If the first digit is 1, the remaining four digits must sum to 31. The maximum sum of four unique digits is 9+8+7+6=30, which is less than 31. Therefore, it's impossible. So, the first digit cannot be 1.Therefore, the first digit must be at least 2.So, let's try first digit as 2. Then, the remaining four digits need to sum to 30 (32-2=30). Let's see if that's possible.The maximum sum of four unique digits is 9+8+7+6=30. So, exactly 30. Therefore, the remaining four digits must be 9,8,7,6. So, the digits are 2,6,7,8,9, which gives the number 26789.Wait, that's the same as before. So, that seems to be the minimal number.But let me check if there's a smaller number by having a different combination.Wait, maybe if we don't take the maximum digits, but instead, have a smaller digit in the second place, but then compensate with larger digits elsewhere.Wait, but since we want the smallest number, we need the digits to be as small as possible from left to right.So, starting with 2, then the next digit should be as small as possible, given the constraints.So, after 2, the next smallest digit is 3, but let's see.Wait, no, because if we take 2 as the first digit, the remaining digits have to sum to 30, which requires 9,8,7,6. So, we can't have a smaller digit than 6 in the second place because 6 is the smallest in that set.Wait, but 6 is larger than 3, so if we can have a smaller digit in the second place, that would make the number smaller.But is that possible? Let's see.Suppose we try to have the first two digits as 2 and 3. Then, the remaining three digits need to sum to 32 - 2 -3=27.So, we need three unique digits that sum to 27, and are larger than 3, and unique.What's the maximum sum for three digits: 9+8+7=24, which is less than 27. So, impossible. Therefore, having 2 and 3 as the first two digits is impossible because the remaining three digits can't sum to 27.Similarly, if we try 2 and 4 as the first two digits, the remaining three digits need to sum to 32 -2 -4=26.Again, the maximum sum for three digits is 24, which is less than 26. So, impossible.Same with 2 and 5: remaining sum is 25, still too high.Wait, 2 and 6: remaining sum is 24, which is exactly 9+8+7=24. So, that works. So, the digits would be 2,6,7,8,9, which is the same as before.Alternatively, if we try 2 and 7: remaining sum is 23. But 23 can be achieved with 9+8+6=23, but 6 is smaller than 7, so arranging them would give 2,6,7,8,9 again.Wait, but if we have 2,7, then the remaining digits would be 6,8,9, but 6 is smaller than 7, so when arranging in ascending order, it would still be 2,6,7,8,9.So, regardless, the smallest number is 26789.But let me check if there's another combination where the first digit is 2, but the second digit is smaller than 6, but still allows the remaining digits to sum up appropriately.Wait, for example, if we have 2,3, then the remaining three digits need to sum to 27, which is impossible as we saw earlier.Similarly, 2,4: remaining sum 26, which is also impossible.2,5: remaining sum 25, which is still too high because the maximum is 24.So, the only way is to have 2,6,7,8,9.Therefore, the smallest number is 26789.Wait, but let me think again. Maybe there's a way to have a smaller number by having a different combination of digits.For example, instead of 2,6,7,8,9, maybe 3,5,7,8,9. Let's see: 3+5+7+8+9=32. So, that's another combination.But arranging them in ascending order would give 35789, which is larger than 26789. So, 26789 is smaller.Alternatively, 3,6,7,8,8: but wait, digits must be unique, so 8 can't be repeated.Wait, another combination: 4,5,7,8,8: again, repetition.Wait, maybe 2,5,7,8,10: but 10 is not a digit.Wait, no, digits can only be 0-9, so 10 is invalid.Alternatively, 2,5,8,9,8: again, repetition.Hmm, seems like 2,6,7,8,9 is the only combination where the first digit is 2 and the remaining digits sum to 30.Wait, but let me check another approach. Maybe instead of taking the maximum digits after 2, we can have a different set.For example, if we take 2, then instead of 6,7,8,9, maybe we can have smaller digits but still sum to 30.Wait, but 2 is fixed as the first digit, so the remaining four digits need to sum to 30. The maximum sum for four digits is 30, which is achieved by 9,8,7,6. So, any other combination would have a sum less than 30, which is not possible because we need exactly 30.Therefore, the only way is to have 9,8,7,6 as the remaining digits.So, the digits are 2,6,7,8,9, which gives the number 26789.Is there a way to have a smaller number by having a different arrangement or different digits?Wait, let's think about using 0 somewhere. If we include 0, maybe we can have a smaller number.But wait, the first digit can't be 0, so 0 can be in the other positions.But if we include 0, we have to adjust the sum accordingly.Let me try: suppose we include 0 as one of the digits. Then, the sum of the other four digits must be 32.So, we need four unique digits (excluding 0 and the first digit) that sum to 32.Wait, but the maximum sum of four unique digits is 9+8+7+6=30, which is less than 32. Therefore, it's impossible to have 0 as one of the digits because the remaining four digits can't sum to 32.Therefore, 0 cannot be included in the digits because it would require the other four digits to sum to 32, which is impossible.So, all digits must be from 1 to 9, with no repetition, and the sum is 32.Therefore, the digits must be 2,6,7,8,9.Wait, but let me check another possibility. Maybe instead of 2,6,7,8,9, we can have a different set where the first digit is 2, but the other digits are arranged differently to get a smaller number.Wait, for example, 2,5,8,9,8: but repetition.Alternatively, 2,5,7,9,9: repetition again.No, that doesn't work.Alternatively, 2,4,9,8,9: repetition.Hmm, seems like 2,6,7,8,9 is the only combination where the digits are unique, sum to 32, and the first digit is 2.Wait, another thought: maybe using a different first digit, like 3, but with smaller digits elsewhere.Wait, if the first digit is 3, then the remaining four digits need to sum to 29 (32-3=29). Let's see if that's possible.The maximum sum for four digits is 30, so 29 is possible.So, we need four unique digits that sum to 29. Let's see: 9+8+7+5=29. So, digits would be 3,5,7,8,9. Arranged in ascending order: 3,5,7,8,9, which gives 35789.But 35789 is larger than 26789, so 26789 is still smaller.Alternatively, another combination: 9+8+6+6=29, but repetition.Wait, 9+8+7+5=29, which is unique.Alternatively, 9+8+6+6=29, but repetition.So, the only way is 3,5,7,8,9, which gives a larger number.Therefore, 26789 is still the smallest.Wait, another idea: maybe using 2 as the first digit, but having a smaller digit in the second place by adjusting other digits.Wait, for example, if we have 2,3, then the remaining three digits need to sum to 27, which is impossible as we saw earlier.Alternatively, 2,4: remaining sum 26, which is also impossible.2,5: remaining sum 25, which is still too high because the maximum for three digits is 24.So, no luck there.Wait, what if we have 2,7: then the remaining three digits need to sum to 23.Wait, 23 can be achieved with 9+8+6=23. So, digits would be 2,6,7,8,9, which is the same as before.So, arranging them in ascending order gives 2,6,7,8,9, which is 26789.Therefore, it seems that 26789 is indeed the smallest number that satisfies the conditions.But let me double-check if there's any other combination.Wait, another approach: let's list all possible combinations of 5 unique digits that sum to 32 and see which one is the smallest when arranged in ascending order.So, starting from the smallest possible first digit, which is 2, as we saw earlier.So, the digits must include 2, and the remaining four digits must sum to 30.As we saw, the only way to get 30 with four unique digits is 9,8,7,6.So, the digits are 2,6,7,8,9.Alternatively, is there another set of four digits that sum to 30 without using 9,8,7,6?Let me see: 9+8+7+6=30.Is there another combination?For example, 9+8+7+6=30.Alternatively, 9+8+7+6=30.Wait, any other combination would require replacing one of these digits with a smaller one, but that would reduce the sum below 30.For example, replacing 6 with 5: 9+8+7+5=29, which is less than 30.Similarly, replacing 7 with 5: 9+8+5+6=28.So, no, there's no other combination of four unique digits that sum to 30.Therefore, the only possible set is 9,8,7,6, which when combined with 2 gives the digits 2,6,7,8,9.Thus, the smallest number is 26789.Wait, just to be thorough, let me check if there's a way to have a smaller number by having a different first digit.Wait, if the first digit is 2, the number starts with 2. If the first digit is 3, the number starts with 3, which is larger. So, 2 is the smallest possible first digit.Therefore, 26789 is indeed the smallest number.Wait, another thought: what if we have a 6-digit number? Wait, but earlier I thought that 5 digits are necessary because 4 digits can't reach 32. Let me confirm that.Wait, the maximum sum for 4 digits is 9+8+7+6=30, which is less than 32. So, 4 digits can't reach 32. Therefore, the number must have at least 5 digits.Therefore, 26789 is the smallest 5-digit number with unique digits summing to 32.Wait, but let me check if there's a 5-digit number starting with 2 and having smaller digits in the subsequent places.Wait, for example, 2,3,4,5,18: but 18 is not a digit.Wait, no, digits can only be 0-9. So, we can't have digits beyond 9.Therefore, the digits must be 2,6,7,8,9.Wait, another idea: maybe using 2,5,9,8,8: but repetition.No, can't do that.Alternatively, 2,5,9,7,9: repetition again.No, that's not allowed.So, it seems that 2,6,7,8,9 is the only valid combination.Therefore, the smallest number is 26789.Wait, just to make sure, let me calculate the sum: 2+6+7+8+9=32. Yes, that's correct.And all digits are unique.And arranging them in ascending order gives the smallest possible number: 26789.So, I think that's the answer."},{"question":"A class of  10  students took a math test. Each problem was solved by exactly  7  of the students. If the first nine students each solved  4  problems, how many problems did the tenth student solve?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: There's a class of 10 students who took a math test. Each problem was solved by exactly 7 students. The first nine students each solved 4 problems. I need to figure out how many problems the tenth student solved. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. There are 10 students in total. Each problem on the test was solved by exactly 7 students. That means for every problem, 7 out of the 10 students got it right, and 3 didn't. Now, the first nine students each solved 4 problems. So, each of these nine students got 4 problems correct. I need to find out how many problems the tenth student solved.I think this is a combinatorial problem, maybe involving some counting principles. Let me think about how to model this.Let me denote the number of problems as P. Each problem was solved by exactly 7 students. So, if I consider all the problems, each contributes 7 correct answers. Therefore, the total number of correct answers across all students is 7P.On the other hand, each of the first nine students solved 4 problems. So, the total number of correct answers from these nine students is 9 * 4 = 36. Let me denote the number of problems solved by the tenth student as x. Then, the total number of correct answers from all ten students is 36 + x.But we also know that the total number of correct answers is 7P. So, 36 + x = 7P. Therefore, x = 7P - 36. Hmm, so if I can find P, the total number of problems, then I can find x.But how do I find P? Let me think. Maybe I can use some other information or constraints.Wait, each problem was solved by exactly 7 students. So, for each problem, 7 students solved it. So, if I think about the number of problems, each problem is associated with 7 students. So, the total number of \\"problem-student\\" pairs is 7P.But another way to look at it is, each student solved a certain number of problems. The first nine solved 4 each, and the tenth solved x. So, the total number of \\"problem-student\\" pairs is also 9*4 + x = 36 + x.So, we have 7P = 36 + x. So, that gives us a relationship between P and x.But we need another equation to solve for both P and x. Maybe we can find another way to relate P and x.Wait, perhaps we can use the fact that each problem was solved by exactly 7 students, so the number of problems is related to how the correct answers are distributed among the students.Alternatively, maybe we can model this using set theory or inclusion-exclusion. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach here.Wait, another thought: Since each problem was solved by exactly 7 students, the number of problems can be related to how many times each student solved a problem.But each of the first nine students solved 4 problems, so each of them has 4 correct answers. The tenth student solved x problems.So, if I think about the total number of correct answers, which is 7P, that's equal to 36 + x.But I also know that each problem was solved by 7 students, so the number of problems is such that 7P is equal to the total correct answers.Wait, maybe I can think about it in terms of the number of pairs of students who both solved the same problem. Hmm, that might complicate things.Alternatively, maybe I can think about the overlap between the problems solved by different students.Wait, another approach: Let's denote the number of problems as P. Each problem was solved by 7 students, so the total number of correct answers is 7P.Each of the first nine students solved 4 problems, so the total correct answers from them is 36. The tenth student solved x problems, so total correct answers is 36 + x = 7P.Therefore, 7P = 36 + x.So, if I can find another equation involving P and x, I can solve for x.Wait, perhaps I can think about how many times the tenth student solved a problem that was also solved by the other students.Each problem was solved by exactly 7 students, so for each problem, 7 students solved it. The tenth student could have solved some of these problems, and the first nine students solved others.But the first nine students solved 4 problems each, so in total, they solved 36 problems. But since each problem was solved by 7 students, the number of distinct problems solved by the first nine students is at most 36 / 7, but that's not an integer. Hmm, maybe that's not the right way.Wait, actually, each problem solved by the first nine students was solved by 6 other students, because each problem was solved by 7 students in total. So, if a problem was solved by one of the first nine students, it was also solved by 6 others.But the tenth student could have solved some of these problems as well.Wait, maybe it's better to think about the number of problems that the tenth student solved. Let me denote x as the number of problems the tenth student solved.Each of these x problems was solved by the tenth student and 6 others. So, the number of times the tenth student's problems were solved by the first nine students is 6x.On the other hand, the first nine students solved 4 problems each, so in total, they solved 36 problems. But some of these problems might have been solved by the tenth student as well.So, the total number of problems solved by the first nine students is 36. But some of these problems were also solved by the tenth student, and some were not.Let me denote y as the number of problems solved by both the first nine students and the tenth student. Then, the number of problems solved only by the first nine students is 36 - y.But each problem solved by the first nine students was solved by 7 students in total. So, for the problems solved only by the first nine students, each was solved by 7 students, all of whom are among the first nine. But wait, that's not possible because each problem was solved by exactly 7 students, but the first nine students can't all solve a problem because there are only 9 students, but each problem is solved by 7.Wait, actually, no. Each problem was solved by exactly 7 students, but those 7 could be any combination of the 10 students.Wait, so for the problems solved by both the first nine and the tenth student, each such problem was solved by the tenth student and 6 of the first nine. So, the number of such problems is y, each contributing 6 to the total count of problems solved by the first nine students.Additionally, the first nine students solved some problems that the tenth student didn't solve. Let me denote z as the number of problems solved only by the first nine students. Each of these problems was solved by 7 students, all among the first nine. So, each such problem contributes 7 to the total count of problems solved by the first nine students.Therefore, the total number of problems solved by the first nine students is y*6 + z*7 = 36.But also, the total number of problems is P = y + z.Because y is the number of problems solved by both the tenth student and some of the first nine, and z is the number of problems solved only by the first nine.So, we have two equations:1. y*6 + z*7 = 362. y + z = PAnd we also have from earlier:3. 7P = 36 + xSo, now we have three equations:Equation 1: 6y + 7z = 36Equation 2: y + z = PEquation 3: 7P = 36 + xSo, let's try to solve these equations.From Equation 2: y = P - zSubstitute into Equation 1:6(P - z) + 7z = 366P - 6z + 7z = 366P + z = 36So, z = 36 - 6PBut z must be a non-negative integer because it's the number of problems.Similarly, from Equation 2, y = P - z = P - (36 - 6P) = 7P - 36But y must also be a non-negative integer.So, both z and y must be non-negative integers.Therefore:z = 36 - 6P ‚â• 0 ‚áí 36 - 6P ‚â• 0 ‚áí 6P ‚â§ 36 ‚áí P ‚â§ 6Similarly, y = 7P - 36 ‚â• 0 ‚áí 7P - 36 ‚â• 0 ‚áí 7P ‚â• 36 ‚áí P ‚â• 36/7 ‚âà 5.14Since P must be an integer, P ‚â• 6So, combining both inequalities: P ‚â§ 6 and P ‚â• 6 ‚áí P = 6So, P = 6Then, z = 36 - 6*6 = 36 - 36 = 0y = 7*6 - 36 = 42 - 36 = 6So, y = 6, z = 0, P = 6Therefore, from Equation 3: 7P = 36 + x ‚áí 7*6 = 36 + x ‚áí 42 = 36 + x ‚áí x = 6So, the tenth student solved 6 problems.Wait, let me verify this.If there are 6 problems in total, each solved by 7 students.The first nine students each solved 4 problems, so total correct answers from them is 36.The tenth student solved 6 problems, so total correct answers is 36 + 6 = 42.Since each problem was solved by 7 students, total correct answers is 6*7 = 42. So, that matches.Now, let's check the distribution.Each of the 6 problems was solved by 7 students.Since z = 0, that means there are no problems solved only by the first nine students. All 6 problems were solved by the tenth student and 6 of the first nine students.So, for each problem, the tenth student solved it, and 6 of the first nine students solved it.Therefore, each of the 6 problems was solved by the tenth student and 6 others.So, each of the first nine students solved 4 problems. Let's see if that's possible.Each of the first nine students solved 4 problems, each of which was solved by the tenth student and 6 others.So, each of the first nine students is part of 4 problems, each of which includes the tenth student and 5 other first nine students.Wait, but each problem involves the tenth student and 6 from the first nine. So, each problem is associated with 6 of the first nine students.Therefore, across all 6 problems, each of the first nine students is involved in some number of problems.Let me think about how many times each of the first nine students is involved in these problems.Each problem involves 6 of the first nine students, and there are 6 problems.So, total number of \\"problem-student\\" pairs for the first nine students is 6*6 = 36.But each of the first nine students solved 4 problems, so total is 9*4 = 36.So, that matches.Therefore, each of the first nine students is involved in exactly 4 problems, each of which is solved by the tenth student and 6 others.Therefore, the distribution is consistent.So, the tenth student solved 6 problems.Wait, just to make sure, let me think about the overlaps.Each problem is solved by the tenth student and 6 others. So, for each problem, 6 of the first nine students solved it.There are 6 problems, so each of the first nine students must have solved 4 problems.So, each of the first nine students is in 4 problems, each of which is solved by 6 students from the first nine.Wait, but 6 problems, each involving 6 students from the first nine, so total \\"problem-student\\" pairs is 6*6=36, which is equal to 9*4=36. So, each of the first nine students is in exactly 4 problems.Therefore, the distribution is possible.So, the answer is 6.**Final Answer**The tenth student solved boxed{6} problems."},{"question":"Given sintheta + costheta = -1, find the value of sinthetacostheta.","answer":"Alright, so I have this trigonometry problem here: Given that sinŒ∏ + cosŒ∏ equals -1, I need to find the value of sinŒ∏cosŒ∏. Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that there are some trigonometric identities that relate sinŒ∏ and cosŒ∏. One of them is the Pythagorean identity, which says that sin¬≤Œ∏ + cos¬≤Œ∏ equals 1. But here, I have sinŒ∏ + cosŒ∏, not their squares. Maybe I can square both sides of the given equation to make use of that identity.Let me write that down. If I square both sides of sinŒ∏ + cosŒ∏ = -1, I get:(sinŒ∏ + cosŒ∏)¬≤ = (-1)¬≤Expanding the left side, I recall that (a + b)¬≤ is a¬≤ + 2ab + b¬≤. So applying that here:sin¬≤Œ∏ + 2sinŒ∏cosŒ∏ + cos¬≤Œ∏ = 1Now, I know from the Pythagorean identity that sin¬≤Œ∏ + cos¬≤Œ∏ is equal to 1. So substituting that in:1 + 2sinŒ∏cosŒ∏ = 1Hmm, okay, so now I can subtract 1 from both sides to solve for 2sinŒ∏cosŒ∏:2sinŒ∏cosŒ∏ = 1 - 12sinŒ∏cosŒ∏ = 0So, if I divide both sides by 2, I get:sinŒ∏cosŒ∏ = 0Wait, so does that mean sinŒ∏cosŒ∏ is zero? That seems straightforward, but let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.Starting again, sinŒ∏ + cosŒ∏ = -1. Squaring both sides gives sin¬≤Œ∏ + 2sinŒ∏cosŒ∏ + cos¬≤Œ∏ = 1. Since sin¬≤Œ∏ + cos¬≤Œ∏ is 1, substituting that in gives 1 + 2sinŒ∏cosŒ∏ = 1. Subtracting 1 from both sides gives 2sinŒ∏cosŒ∏ = 0, so sinŒ∏cosŒ∏ = 0.That seems correct. So, sinŒ∏cosŒ∏ is zero. But just to be thorough, let me think about what this implies. If sinŒ∏cosŒ∏ is zero, then either sinŒ∏ is zero or cosŒ∏ is zero.But wait, if sinŒ∏ is zero, then cosŒ∏ would have to be -1 because sinŒ∏ + cosŒ∏ = -1. Similarly, if cosŒ∏ is zero, then sinŒ∏ would have to be -1. Let me check these possibilities.Case 1: sinŒ∏ = 0. Then cosŒ∏ = -1. So, Œ∏ is an angle where cosine is -1, which occurs at Œ∏ = œÄ + 2œÄk, where k is any integer. At these angles, sinŒ∏ is indeed 0, so sinŒ∏ + cosŒ∏ = 0 + (-1) = -1, which satisfies the given equation.Case 2: cosŒ∏ = 0. Then sinŒ∏ = -1. So, Œ∏ is an angle where sine is -1, which occurs at Œ∏ = 3œÄ/2 + 2œÄk, where k is any integer. At these angles, cosŒ∏ is indeed 0, so sinŒ∏ + cosŒ∏ = -1 + 0 = -1, which also satisfies the given equation.So, both cases work, and in both cases, sinŒ∏cosŒ∏ is zero because either sinŒ∏ or cosŒ∏ is zero. Therefore, my answer seems consistent.Just to make sure, let me plug in specific values of Œ∏ and see if it holds.For Œ∏ = œÄ: sinœÄ = 0, cosœÄ = -1. So, sinœÄ + cosœÄ = 0 + (-1) = -1, which is correct. And sinœÄ * cosœÄ = 0 * (-1) = 0.For Œ∏ = 3œÄ/2: sin(3œÄ/2) = -1, cos(3œÄ/2) = 0. So, sin(3œÄ/2) + cos(3œÄ/2) = -1 + 0 = -1, which is correct. And sin(3œÄ/2) * cos(3œÄ/2) = (-1) * 0 = 0.So, both specific examples confirm that sinŒ∏cosŒ∏ is indeed zero.Therefore, after carefully going through the problem, squaring both sides, using the Pythagorean identity, checking the cases, and verifying with specific angles, I can confidently say that sinŒ∏cosŒ∏ equals zero.**Final Answer**The value of sinthetacostheta is boxed{0}."},{"question":"Let ( a ) and ( b ) be real numbers such that ( 17left(a^{2}+b^{2}right)-30ab-16=0 ).

Hmm, okay, let me try to unpack this step by step.First, let me write down both equations to have them clear:1. The constraint: ( 17(a^2 + b^2) - 30ab - 16 = 0 )2. The expression to maximize: ( sqrt{16a^2 + 4b^2 - 16ab - 12a + 6b + 9} )I notice that both equations involve quadratic terms in ( a ) and ( b ), so maybe I can manipulate them to find a relationship or simplify the expression.Starting with the constraint equation:( 17(a^2 + b^2) - 30ab - 16 = 0 )Let me expand this:( 17a^2 + 17b^2 - 30ab - 16 = 0 )Hmm, this looks like a quadratic form. Maybe I can write it in terms of ( (a - b) ) or something similar? Let me see.Alternatively, perhaps I can express this as a quadratic in terms of ( a ) or ( b ). Let me try to rearrange the terms:( 17a^2 - 30ab + 17b^2 = 16 )Wait, this is symmetric in ( a ) and ( b ), which might be useful. Maybe I can think of this as a quadratic in ( a ):( 17a^2 - 30b a + (17b^2 - 16) = 0 )But solving for ( a ) in terms of ( b ) might not be straightforward. Alternatively, maybe I can complete the square or use some substitution.Let me consider the expression inside the square root that I need to maximize:( 16a^2 + 4b^2 - 16ab - 12a + 6b + 9 )This also looks quadratic. Maybe I can rewrite this expression in a more manageable form, perhaps completing the square or expressing it as a square of some linear combination.Let me try to group the terms:First, group the quadratic terms:( 16a^2 + 4b^2 - 16ab )Then the linear terms:( -12a + 6b )And the constant term:( +9 )So, let me handle the quadratic part first:( 16a^2 + 4b^2 - 16ab )I can factor out a 4:( 4(4a^2 + b^2 - 4ab) )Hmm, inside the parentheses: ( 4a^2 - 4ab + b^2 ). Wait, that looks like a perfect square:( (2a - b)^2 = 4a^2 - 4ab + b^2 )Yes! So, the quadratic part simplifies to:( 4(2a - b)^2 )Great, so the expression becomes:( 4(2a - b)^2 - 12a + 6b + 9 )Now, let's look at the linear terms: ( -12a + 6b ). Maybe I can factor something out here as well. Let's factor out a -6:( -6(2a - b) )So, substituting back, the entire expression is:( 4(2a - b)^2 - 6(2a - b) + 9 )Hmm, this looks like a quadratic in terms of ( (2a - b) ). Let me denote ( x = 2a - b ). Then the expression becomes:( 4x^2 - 6x + 9 )So, the expression inside the square root simplifies to ( 4x^2 - 6x + 9 ), where ( x = 2a - b ). Therefore, the expression to maximize is ( sqrt{4x^2 - 6x + 9} ).Now, my goal is to find the maximum value of ( sqrt{4x^2 - 6x + 9} ), given that ( x = 2a - b ) and ( a ) and ( b ) satisfy the constraint ( 17(a^2 + b^2) - 30ab = 16 ).So, perhaps I can express the constraint in terms of ( x ) as well. Let me try that.Given ( x = 2a - b ), maybe I can express ( b ) in terms of ( a ) and ( x ):( b = 2a - x )Substituting this into the constraint equation:( 17(a^2 + b^2) - 30ab = 16 )Replace ( b ) with ( 2a - x ):( 17left(a^2 + (2a - x)^2right) - 30a(2a - x) = 16 )Let me expand this step by step.First, compute ( (2a - x)^2 ):( (2a - x)^2 = 4a^2 - 4a x + x^2 )So, the first part inside the brackets becomes:( a^2 + 4a^2 - 4a x + x^2 = 5a^2 - 4a x + x^2 )Multiply by 17:( 17(5a^2 - 4a x + x^2) = 85a^2 - 68a x + 17x^2 )Now, compute the second part: ( -30a(2a - x) ):( -30a(2a - x) = -60a^2 + 30a x )So, combining both parts:( 85a^2 - 68a x + 17x^2 - 60a^2 + 30a x = 16 )Simplify the terms:- ( 85a^2 - 60a^2 = 25a^2 )- ( -68a x + 30a x = -38a x )- ( 17x^2 ) remains as is.So, the equation becomes:( 25a^2 - 38a x + 17x^2 = 16 )Hmm, so now we have:( 25a^2 - 38a x + 17x^2 = 16 )This is another quadratic equation, but now in terms of ( a ) and ( x ). Maybe I can write this as a quadratic in ( a ):( 25a^2 - 38x a + (17x^2 - 16) = 0 )This is a quadratic in ( a ), so for real solutions to exist, the discriminant must be non-negative.The discriminant ( D ) is:( D = ( -38x )^2 - 4 times 25 times (17x^2 - 16) )Compute ( D ):( D = 1444x^2 - 100(17x^2 - 16) )Simplify:( D = 1444x^2 - 1700x^2 + 1600 )Combine like terms:( D = (1444 - 1700)x^2 + 1600 = (-256x^2) + 1600 )So, ( D = -256x^2 + 1600 )For real solutions, ( D geq 0 ):( -256x^2 + 1600 geq 0 )Multiply both sides by -1 (remembering to reverse the inequality):( 256x^2 - 1600 leq 0 )Divide both sides by 256:( x^2 - frac{1600}{256} leq 0 )Simplify ( frac{1600}{256} ):Divide numerator and denominator by 16: ( frac{100}{16} = 6.25 )So, ( x^2 - 6.25 leq 0 ) => ( x^2 leq 6.25 ) => ( |x| leq 2.5 )So, ( x ) is between -2.5 and 2.5.Therefore, ( x in [-2.5, 2.5] )Okay, so now we know that ( x ) is bounded between -2.5 and 2.5.Now, going back to the expression we need to maximize: ( sqrt{4x^2 - 6x + 9} )Let me denote ( f(x) = sqrt{4x^2 - 6x + 9} ). We need to find the maximum of ( f(x) ) over ( x in [-2.5, 2.5] ).Since the square root function is monotonically increasing, the maximum of ( f(x) ) occurs at the maximum of the quadratic inside, which is ( 4x^2 - 6x + 9 ).So, let me consider ( g(x) = 4x^2 - 6x + 9 ). We need to find its maximum on the interval ( x in [-2.5, 2.5] ).Quadratic functions have their extrema at the vertex or at the endpoints of the interval. Since the coefficient of ( x^2 ) is positive (4), the parabola opens upwards, so the minimum occurs at the vertex, and the maximum occurs at one of the endpoints.Therefore, the maximum of ( g(x) ) on ( [-2.5, 2.5] ) will be either at ( x = -2.5 ) or ( x = 2.5 ).Let me compute ( g(-2.5) ) and ( g(2.5) ):First, ( g(-2.5) = 4(-2.5)^2 - 6(-2.5) + 9 )Compute each term:- ( 4(-2.5)^2 = 4 times 6.25 = 25 )- ( -6(-2.5) = 15 )- ( +9 )So, ( g(-2.5) = 25 + 15 + 9 = 49 )Next, ( g(2.5) = 4(2.5)^2 - 6(2.5) + 9 )Compute each term:- ( 4(2.5)^2 = 4 times 6.25 = 25 )- ( -6(2.5) = -15 )- ( +9 )So, ( g(2.5) = 25 - 15 + 9 = 19 )Therefore, ( g(-2.5) = 49 ) and ( g(2.5) = 19 ). So, the maximum of ( g(x) ) on the interval is 49, occurring at ( x = -2.5 ).Therefore, the maximum value of ( f(x) = sqrt{g(x)} ) is ( sqrt{49} = 7 ).Wait, hold on. So, does that mean the maximum value is 7? That seems straightforward, but let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.First, I transformed the original expression into ( sqrt{4x^2 - 6x + 9} ) where ( x = 2a - b ). Then, I expressed the constraint in terms of ( x ) and found that ( x ) must lie between -2.5 and 2.5. Then, I considered the quadratic inside the square root, found that it's maximum at the endpoints, computed the values, and found 49 at ( x = -2.5 ), leading to 7.But wait, before I conclude, let me make sure that when ( x = -2.5 ), there exist real numbers ( a ) and ( b ) satisfying both ( x = 2a - b = -2.5 ) and the original constraint.Because sometimes, even if the quadratic allows ( x ) to reach a certain value, the original variables ( a ) and ( b ) might not satisfy the constraint.So, let me verify if when ( x = -2.5 ), there are real ( a ) and ( b ) such that ( 2a - b = -2.5 ) and ( 17(a^2 + b^2) - 30ab = 16 ).Given ( x = -2.5 ), so ( 2a - b = -2.5 ) => ( b = 2a + 2.5 )Substitute ( b = 2a + 2.5 ) into the constraint:( 17(a^2 + b^2) - 30ab = 16 )Compute ( b^2 ):( (2a + 2.5)^2 = 4a^2 + 10a + 6.25 )Compute ( ab ):( a(2a + 2.5) = 2a^2 + 2.5a )So, substitute back:( 17(a^2 + 4a^2 + 10a + 6.25) - 30(2a^2 + 2.5a) = 16 )Simplify inside the brackets:( a^2 + 4a^2 + 10a + 6.25 = 5a^2 + 10a + 6.25 )Multiply by 17:( 17(5a^2 + 10a + 6.25) = 85a^2 + 170a + 106.25 )Compute the second term:( -30(2a^2 + 2.5a) = -60a^2 - 75a )Combine both parts:( 85a^2 + 170a + 106.25 - 60a^2 - 75a = 16 )Simplify:- ( 85a^2 - 60a^2 = 25a^2 )- ( 170a - 75a = 95a )- ( 106.25 ) remains.So, the equation becomes:( 25a^2 + 95a + 106.25 = 16 )Subtract 16 from both sides:( 25a^2 + 95a + 90.25 = 0 )Now, let's solve this quadratic equation for ( a ):Quadratic equation: ( 25a^2 + 95a + 90.25 = 0 )Compute discriminant ( D ):( D = 95^2 - 4 times 25 times 90.25 )Calculate each term:- ( 95^2 = 9025 )- ( 4 times 25 = 100 )- ( 100 times 90.25 = 9025 )So, ( D = 9025 - 9025 = 0 )Since the discriminant is zero, there is exactly one real solution:( a = frac{-95}{2 times 25} = frac{-95}{50} = -1.9 )So, ( a = -1.9 ). Then, ( b = 2a + 2.5 = 2(-1.9) + 2.5 = -3.8 + 2.5 = -1.3 )Therefore, when ( x = -2.5 ), we have ( a = -1.9 ) and ( b = -1.3 ), which are real numbers satisfying the original constraint.Thus, the maximum value of the expression is indeed 7.Wait, but just to be thorough, let me check if ( x = -2.5 ) is attainable, as sometimes endpoints might not be achievable due to the constraints.But as we just saw, substituting ( x = -2.5 ) gives a valid solution with real ( a ) and ( b ), so it is attainable.Therefore, the maximum value is 7.But hold on, just to make sure, let me compute the expression inside the square root when ( a = -1.9 ) and ( b = -1.3 ):Compute ( 16a^2 + 4b^2 - 16ab - 12a + 6b + 9 )First, compute each term:- ( 16a^2 = 16(-1.9)^2 = 16(3.61) = 57.76 )- ( 4b^2 = 4(-1.3)^2 = 4(1.69) = 6.76 )- ( -16ab = -16(-1.9)(-1.3) ). Let's compute ( (-1.9)(-1.3) = 2.47 ), so ( -16 times 2.47 = -39.52 )- ( -12a = -12(-1.9) = 22.8 )- ( 6b = 6(-1.3) = -7.8 )- ( +9 )Now, sum all these up:57.76 + 6.76 - 39.52 + 22.8 - 7.8 + 9Compute step by step:57.76 + 6.76 = 64.5264.52 - 39.52 = 2525 + 22.8 = 47.847.8 - 7.8 = 4040 + 9 = 49So, the expression inside the square root is 49, and the square root of 49 is 7. Perfect, that's consistent.Therefore, all steps check out, and the maximum value is indeed 7.**Final Answer**boxed{7}"},{"question":"Given x, y in mathbb{R}^+, and 4x^2+9y^2=36, find the maximum value of x + 2y.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the maximum value of ( x + 2y ) given that ( 4x^2 + 9y^2 = 36 ) and both ( x ) and ( y ) are positive real numbers. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that when dealing with equations involving squares and trying to maximize or minimize a linear expression, methods like substitution or using Lagrange multipliers come to mind. Since this is a problem with two variables, maybe substitution would be simpler.Looking at the equation ( 4x^2 + 9y^2 = 36 ), I notice that it resembles the standard form of an ellipse. The standard form is ( frac{x^2}{a^2} + frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 ). If I divide both sides by 36, I get ( frac{x^2}{9} + frac{y^2}{4} = 1 ). So, this is an ellipse centered at the origin with semi-major axis 3 along the x-axis and semi-minor axis 2 along the y-axis.Now, I need to maximize ( x + 2y ). This is a linear function, and I know that the maximum of a linear function over an ellipse occurs at a point where the gradient of the function is parallel to the gradient of the ellipse. Alternatively, I can parameterize the ellipse and then maximize the function.Let me try parameterizing the ellipse. For an ellipse ( frac{x^2}{a^2} + frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 ), a standard parameterization is ( x = a cos theta ) and ( y = b sin theta ), where ( theta ) is the parameter varying from 0 to ( 2pi ).So, in this case, ( a = 3 ) and ( b = 2 ). Therefore, I can write:[x = 3 cos theta][y = 2 sin theta]Substituting these into the expression ( x + 2y ), we get:[x + 2y = 3 cos theta + 2 times 2 sin theta = 3 cos theta + 4 sin theta]So, now the problem reduces to finding the maximum value of ( 3 cos theta + 4 sin theta ).I remember that expressions of the form ( A cos theta + B sin theta ) can be rewritten using the amplitude-phase form. The maximum value of such an expression is ( sqrt{A^2 + B^2} ). Let me verify that.Yes, because ( A cos theta + B sin theta = R cos(theta - phi) ), where ( R = sqrt{A^2 + B^2} ) and ( phi ) is some phase shift. The maximum value of cosine is 1, so the maximum of the expression is ( R ).Applying this to ( 3 cos theta + 4 sin theta ), we have ( A = 3 ) and ( B = 4 ). Therefore, the maximum value is ( sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = sqrt{9 + 16} = sqrt{25} = 5 ).Wait, so does that mean the maximum value of ( x + 2y ) is 5? Let me double-check.Alternatively, I can use calculus to find the maximum. Let's consider ( f(theta) = 3 cos theta + 4 sin theta ). To find its maximum, take the derivative with respect to ( theta ) and set it to zero.The derivative is:[f'(theta) = -3 sin theta + 4 cos theta]Setting this equal to zero:[-3 sin theta + 4 cos theta = 0][4 cos theta = 3 sin theta][frac{sin theta}{cos theta} = frac{4}{3}][tan theta = frac{4}{3}]So, ( theta = arctanleft( frac{4}{3} right) ). Let me compute ( f(theta) ) at this angle.First, let's find ( cos theta ) and ( sin theta ). Since ( tan theta = frac{4}{3} ), we can imagine a right triangle where the opposite side is 4 and the adjacent side is 3, so the hypotenuse is 5.Therefore:[sin theta = frac{4}{5}][cos theta = frac{3}{5}]Substituting back into ( f(theta) ):[f(theta) = 3 times frac{3}{5} + 4 times frac{4}{5} = frac{9}{5} + frac{16}{5} = frac{25}{5} = 5]So, yes, that confirms the maximum value is indeed 5.Alternatively, I could have used the method of Lagrange multipliers. Let me try that approach as a check.We want to maximize ( f(x, y) = x + 2y ) subject to the constraint ( g(x, y) = 4x^2 + 9y^2 - 36 = 0 ).The method of Lagrange multipliers tells us that at the maximum, the gradients of ( f ) and ( g ) are parallel. That is, there exists a scalar ( lambda ) such that:[nabla f = lambda nabla g]Calculating the gradients:[nabla f = left( frac{partial f}{partial x}, frac{partial f}{partial y} right) = (1, 2)][nabla g = left( frac{partial g}{partial x}, frac{partial g}{partial y} right) = (8x, 18y)]So, setting ( nabla f = lambda nabla g ), we get:[1 = lambda times 8x quad (1)][2 = lambda times 18y quad (2)]From equation (1), ( lambda = frac{1}{8x} ). From equation (2), ( lambda = frac{2}{18y} = frac{1}{9y} ).Setting these equal:[frac{1}{8x} = frac{1}{9y}]Cross-multiplying:[9y = 8x][y = frac{8}{9}x]Now, substitute ( y = frac{8}{9}x ) into the constraint equation ( 4x^2 + 9y^2 = 36 ):[4x^2 + 9 left( frac{8}{9}x right)^2 = 36]Simplify:[4x^2 + 9 times frac{64}{81}x^2 = 36][4x^2 + frac{64}{9}x^2 = 36]Convert 4 to ninths to combine:[frac{36}{9}x^2 + frac{64}{9}x^2 = 36][frac{100}{9}x^2 = 36]Multiply both sides by ( frac{9}{100} ):[x^2 = frac{36 times 9}{100} = frac{324}{100} = frac{81}{25}]Taking square roots:[x = frac{9}{5} quad (text{since } x > 0)]Then, ( y = frac{8}{9}x = frac{8}{9} times frac{9}{5} = frac{8}{5} ).Now, compute ( x + 2y ):[x + 2y = frac{9}{5} + 2 times frac{8}{5} = frac{9}{5} + frac{16}{5} = frac{25}{5} = 5]So, again, we get the maximum value as 5. That's consistent with the previous method.Just to make sure, let me visualize this. The ellipse ( 4x^2 + 9y^2 = 36 ) is stretched more along the x-axis. The function ( x + 2y ) is a straight line, and we're looking for the point on the ellipse where this line touches the ellipse and is tangent to it. The maximum value occurs where the line is just touching the ellipse, which is exactly what we found.Alternatively, thinking in terms of vectors, the expression ( x + 2y ) can be seen as the dot product of the vector ( (x, y) ) with the vector ( (1, 2) ). The maximum value occurs when ( (x, y) ) is in the same direction as ( (1, 2) ), scaled appropriately to lie on the ellipse. But since the ellipse isn't a circle, the direction isn't exactly the same, but the method still applies through Lagrange multipliers or parameterization.Wait, actually, another approach could be using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. Let me try that.The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states that for vectors ( mathbf{a} ) and ( mathbf{b} ), ( |mathbf{a} cdot mathbf{b}| leq |mathbf{a}| |mathbf{b}| ).Let me represent ( x + 2y ) as the dot product of ( (x, y) ) and ( (1, 2) ). So, ( x + 2y = (x, y) cdot (1, 2) ).But we have the constraint ( 4x^2 + 9y^2 = 36 ). Let me write this as ( (2x)^2 + (3y)^2 = 6^2 ). So, if I let ( u = 2x ) and ( v = 3y ), then the constraint becomes ( u^2 + v^2 = 36 ), which is a circle of radius 6.Express ( x + 2y ) in terms of ( u ) and ( v ):[x = frac{u}{2}, quad y = frac{v}{3}]So,[x + 2y = frac{u}{2} + 2 times frac{v}{3} = frac{u}{2} + frac{2v}{3}]Now, this is a linear combination of ( u ) and ( v ). Let me write this as a dot product:[frac{u}{2} + frac{2v}{3} = left( frac{1}{2}, frac{2}{3} right) cdot (u, v)]So, applying Cauchy-Schwarz:[left| left( frac{1}{2}, frac{2}{3} right) cdot (u, v) right| leq left| left( frac{1}{2}, frac{2}{3} right) right| times |(u, v)|]Compute the norms:[left| left( frac{1}{2}, frac{2}{3} right) right| = sqrt{left( frac{1}{2} right)^2 + left( frac{2}{3} right)^2} = sqrt{frac{1}{4} + frac{4}{9}} = sqrt{frac{9}{36} + frac{16}{36}} = sqrt{frac{25}{36}} = frac{5}{6}][|(u, v)| = sqrt{u^2 + v^2} = sqrt{36} = 6]Therefore, the maximum value is:[frac{5}{6} times 6 = 5]So, again, we get the maximum value as 5. That's consistent with all the previous methods.Just to recap, I've tried three different approaches:1. Parameterizing the ellipse and using trigonometric identities.2. Using the method of Lagrange multipliers.3. Applying the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality after a substitution.All three methods led me to the same conclusion that the maximum value of ( x + 2y ) is 5. That gives me confidence that the answer is correct.I think I'm pretty thorough here. I considered multiple methods, checked each step, and made sure the results were consistent. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I feel confident about the solution.**Final Answer**The maximum value of ( x + 2y ) is boxed{5}."},{"question":"If the parabola y=ax^{2}+bx+5 passes through the point left(-2,9right), then the value of the algebraic expression 2a-b+6 is ______.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: the parabola given by the equation y = ax¬≤ + bx + 5 passes through the point (-2, 9). I need to find the value of the algebraic expression 2a - b + 6. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that if a point lies on a parabola, its coordinates must satisfy the equation of the parabola. So, if the point (-2, 9) is on the parabola y = ax¬≤ + bx + 5, then when I plug in x = -2 into the equation, y should equal 9. That makes sense.So, let me substitute x = -2 and y = 9 into the equation:9 = a*(-2)¬≤ + b*(-2) + 5Let me compute each term step by step. The square of -2 is 4, so the first term is 4a. The second term is b multiplied by -2, which is -2b. The constant term is 5. So putting it all together:9 = 4a - 2b + 5Now, I can simplify this equation. Let me subtract 5 from both sides to isolate the terms with a and b:9 - 5 = 4a - 2bWhich simplifies to:4 = 4a - 2bHmm, okay. So now I have an equation: 4a - 2b = 4. I need to find the value of 2a - b + 6. Wait a second, 2a - b is part of that expression. Maybe I can manipulate the equation I have to get 2a - b.Looking at the equation 4a - 2b = 4, I notice that both terms on the left side have a factor of 2. Let me factor out a 2:2*(2a - b) = 4So, 2*(2a - b) equals 4. If I divide both sides by 2, I get:2a - b = 2Oh, that's perfect! Because the expression I need is 2a - b + 6. So, if 2a - b is 2, then adding 6 to that would give me:2 + 6 = 8So, the value of 2a - b + 6 is 8.Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the substitution:9 = a*(-2)¬≤ + b*(-2) + 59 = 4a - 2b + 5Subtract 5: 4 = 4a - 2bFactor out 2: 2*(2a - b) = 4Divide by 2: 2a - b = 2Add 6: 2a - b + 6 = 8Yes, that seems correct. So, I think the answer is 8.**Final Answer**The value of the algebraic expression is boxed{8}."},{"question":"Let ( a_{0}, a_{1}, a_{2}, ldots ) denote the sequence of real numbers such that ( a_{0} = 2 ) and ( a_{n+1} = frac{a_{n}}{1 + a_{n}} ) for ( n geq 0 ). Compute ( a_{2012} ).","answer":"Alright, so I have this sequence where ( a_0 = 2 ) and each subsequent term is defined by ( a_{n+1} = frac{a_n}{1 + a_n} ). I need to find ( a_{2012} ). Hmm, okay, let's see how I can approach this.First, maybe I should write out the first few terms to see if I can spot a pattern. Starting with ( a_0 = 2 ).Then, ( a_1 = frac{a_0}{1 + a_0} = frac{2}{1 + 2} = frac{2}{3} ).Next, ( a_2 = frac{a_1}{1 + a_1} = frac{frac{2}{3}}{1 + frac{2}{3}} = frac{frac{2}{3}}{frac{5}{3}} = frac{2}{5} ).Continuing, ( a_3 = frac{a_2}{1 + a_2} = frac{frac{2}{5}}{1 + frac{2}{5}} = frac{frac{2}{5}}{frac{7}{5}} = frac{2}{7} ).Wait a second, that seems like a pattern. Let me write down the terms:- ( a_0 = 2 = frac{2}{1} )- ( a_1 = frac{2}{3} )- ( a_2 = frac{2}{5} )- ( a_3 = frac{2}{7} )So, it looks like the denominator is increasing by 2 each time. So, ( a_n = frac{2}{2n + 1} ). Let me test this hypothesis.Assume ( a_n = frac{2}{2n + 1} ). Then, ( a_{n+1} = frac{a_n}{1 + a_n} = frac{frac{2}{2n + 1}}{1 + frac{2}{2n + 1}} ).Simplify the denominator: ( 1 + frac{2}{2n + 1} = frac{(2n + 1) + 2}{2n + 1} = frac{2n + 3}{2n + 1} ).So, ( a_{n+1} = frac{frac{2}{2n + 1}}{frac{2n + 3}{2n + 1}} = frac{2}{2n + 3} ).Which is exactly ( frac{2}{2(n + 1) + 1} ). So, the formula holds for ( a_{n+1} ) if it holds for ( a_n ). Since it holds for ( a_0 ), by induction, it holds for all ( n ).Therefore, the general term is ( a_n = frac{2}{2n + 1} ).So, to find ( a_{2012} ), plug in ( n = 2012 ):( a_{2012} = frac{2}{2 times 2012 + 1} = frac{2}{4024 + 1} = frac{2}{4025} ).Wait, let me double-check my calculations. 2 times 2012 is 4024, plus 1 is 4025. So, yes, ( a_{2012} = frac{2}{4025} ).Just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the pattern, let me compute ( a_4 ) using the recursive formula and my general formula.Using the recursive formula:( a_3 = frac{2}{7} ), so ( a_4 = frac{frac{2}{7}}{1 + frac{2}{7}} = frac{frac{2}{7}}{frac{9}{7}} = frac{2}{9} ).Using the general formula: ( a_4 = frac{2}{2 times 4 + 1} = frac{2}{9} ). Perfect, matches.So, I feel confident that the general term is correct. Therefore, ( a_{2012} = frac{2}{4025} ).**Final Answer**The value of ( a_{2012} ) is boxed{dfrac{2}{4025}}."},{"question":"A certain tourist goods distribution store wants to purchase two types of souvenirs, A and B.

Find the cost price of types A and B respectively.2. If the store can make a profit of 5 yuan for each piece of type A sold and 7 yuan for each piece of type B sold, and the store is prepared to spend no more than 900 yuan to purchase 40 pieces of types A and B, and when all these souvenirs are sold, the total profit is not less than 216 yuan, how should they purchase the goods to maximize the total profit, and what is the maximum profit?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a tourist goods store that wants to buy two types of souvenirs, A and B. There are two parts to the problem. The first part is to find the cost price of each type, and the second part is about maximizing profit given certain constraints. Let me try to work through each part step by step.Starting with part 1: They spend 380 yuan to buy 7 pieces of type A and 8 pieces of type B. They also spend 380 yuan to buy 10 pieces of type A and 6 pieces of type B. So, it seems like we have two equations here with two variables, which should be solvable.Let me denote the cost price of type A as ( x ) yuan per piece and type B as ( y ) yuan per piece. Then, according to the problem:For the first purchase:( 7x + 8y = 380 ) yuan.For the second purchase:( 10x + 6y = 380 ) yuan.So, we have the system of equations:1. ( 7x + 8y = 380 )2. ( 10x + 6y = 380 )I need to solve for ( x ) and ( y ). Let me use the elimination method. Maybe I can eliminate one variable by making the coefficients equal.Looking at the coefficients of ( x ) and ( y ), perhaps I can eliminate ( y ) by making the coefficients of ( y ) the same in both equations. Let me see:Equation 1: ( 7x + 8y = 380 )Equation 2: ( 10x + 6y = 380 )To eliminate ( y ), I can multiply equation 1 by 3 and equation 2 by 4 so that the coefficients of ( y ) become 24 in both.Multiplying equation 1 by 3:( 21x + 24y = 1140 ) (Equation 3)Multiplying equation 2 by 4:( 40x + 24y = 1520 ) (Equation 4)Now, subtract equation 3 from equation 4 to eliminate ( y ):( (40x + 24y) - (21x + 24y) = 1520 - 1140 )Simplify:( 19x = 380 )So, ( x = 380 / 19 = 20 ).So, the cost price of type A is 20 yuan per piece.Now, substitute ( x = 20 ) back into one of the original equations to find ( y ). Let's take equation 1:( 7(20) + 8y = 380 )Calculate:( 140 + 8y = 380 )Subtract 140 from both sides:( 8y = 240 )Divide by 8:( y = 30 )So, the cost price of type B is 30 yuan per piece.Let me verify this with equation 2:( 10(20) + 6(30) = 200 + 180 = 380 ). Yep, that works.Alright, so part 1 is solved. Type A costs 20 yuan each, and type B costs 30 yuan each.Moving on to part 2. The store wants to purchase 40 pieces of types A and B, spending no more than 900 yuan. Also, when sold, the total profit should be at least 216 yuan. They make a profit of 5 yuan per A and 7 yuan per B. We need to figure out how many of each to purchase to maximize the total profit.So, let me define variables:Let ( a ) be the number of type A souvenirs purchased.Let ( b ) be the number of type B souvenirs purchased.We have the following constraints:1. Total number of souvenirs: ( a + b = 40 )2. Total cost: ( 20a + 30b leq 900 )3. Total profit: ( 5a + 7b geq 216 )And we want to maximize the profit ( P = 5a + 7b ).Wait, but since ( a + b = 40 ), we can express ( b = 40 - a ). So, maybe we can substitute ( b ) in terms of ( a ) into the other equations.Let me do that.First, substitute ( b = 40 - a ) into the cost constraint:( 20a + 30(40 - a) leq 900 )Simplify:( 20a + 1200 - 30a leq 900 )Combine like terms:( -10a + 1200 leq 900 )Subtract 1200 from both sides:( -10a leq -300 )Divide both sides by -10 (remembering to reverse the inequality sign):( a geq 30 )So, the number of type A souvenirs must be at least 30.Now, substitute ( b = 40 - a ) into the profit constraint:( 5a + 7(40 - a) geq 216 )Simplify:( 5a + 280 - 7a geq 216 )Combine like terms:( -2a + 280 geq 216 )Subtract 280 from both sides:( -2a geq -64 )Divide both sides by -2 (again, reverse inequality):( a leq 32 )So, the number of type A souvenirs must be at most 32.Putting these together, ( 30 leq a leq 32 ). Since ( a ) must be an integer (can't buy a fraction of a souvenir), ( a ) can be 30, 31, or 32.Now, since we want to maximize the profit ( P = 5a + 7b ), and since ( b = 40 - a ), we can express ( P ) in terms of ( a ):( P = 5a + 7(40 - a) = 5a + 280 - 7a = -2a + 280 )So, ( P = -2a + 280 ). To maximize ( P ), since the coefficient of ( a ) is negative, we need to minimize ( a ).Wait, that seems counterintuitive. Let me check my substitution.Wait, ( P = 5a + 7b ), and ( b = 40 - a ), so ( P = 5a + 7(40 - a) ). That's correct. So, ( P = 5a + 280 - 7a = -2a + 280 ). So, yes, as ( a ) increases, ( P ) decreases. Therefore, to maximize ( P ), we need to minimize ( a ).But according to our constraints, ( a geq 30 ). So, the minimum ( a ) can be is 30. Therefore, to maximize profit, the store should purchase 30 type A and 10 type B.Wait, but let me check if that satisfies all constraints.Total cost: ( 20*30 + 30*10 = 600 + 300 = 900 ) yuan. That's within the 900 yuan limit.Total profit: ( 5*30 + 7*10 = 150 + 70 = 220 ) yuan. Which is more than 216, so that's good.But just to make sure, let's check if ( a = 31 ) and ( a = 32 ) would give us lower profits.For ( a = 31 ):Profit: ( -2*31 + 280 = -62 + 280 = 218 ) yuan.For ( a = 32 ):Profit: ( -2*32 + 280 = -64 + 280 = 216 ) yuan.So, as ( a ) increases, profit decreases. So, maximum profit is at ( a = 30 ), which is 220 yuan.Wait, but hold on, is there a way to get a higher profit? Because 220 is more than 216, but maybe if we adjust the numbers differently?Wait, but according to the constraints, ( a ) can't be less than 30 because of the cost constraint. So, 30 is the minimum, which gives the maximum profit.But let me think again: the profit function is ( P = -2a + 280 ). So, it's a linear function decreasing with ( a ). So, yes, the maximum occurs at the smallest ( a ), which is 30.Therefore, the optimal purchase is 30 type A and 10 type B, resulting in a maximum profit of 220 yuan.But just to be thorough, let me check if there's any other way to interpret the problem.Wait, the problem says \\"the store is prepared to spend no more than 900 yuan to purchase 40 pieces of types A and B\\". So, does that mean they have to buy exactly 40 pieces? Or can they buy fewer?Looking back at the problem: \\"the store is prepared to spend no more than 900 yuan to purchase 40 pieces of types A and B\\". So, it seems like they are purchasing exactly 40 pieces, with the total cost not exceeding 900 yuan. So, ( a + b = 40 ), and ( 20a + 30b leq 900 ).So, yes, my initial interpretation was correct.Therefore, the answer is to purchase 30 type A and 10 type B, with a maximum profit of 220 yuan.But just to double-check, let me compute the cost and profit for each possible ( a ):- ( a = 30 ), ( b = 10 ):  - Cost: 30*20 + 10*30 = 600 + 300 = 900 yuan.  - Profit: 30*5 + 10*7 = 150 + 70 = 220 yuan.- ( a = 31 ), ( b = 9 ):  - Cost: 31*20 + 9*30 = 620 + 270 = 890 yuan.  - Profit: 31*5 + 9*7 = 155 + 63 = 218 yuan.- ( a = 32 ), ( b = 8 ):  - Cost: 32*20 + 8*30 = 640 + 240 = 880 yuan.  - Profit: 32*5 + 8*7 = 160 + 56 = 216 yuan.So, as ( a ) increases, profit decreases, as we saw. So, 30 type A and 10 type B gives the maximum profit of 220 yuan.Therefore, the optimal solution is to purchase 30 type A and 10 type B souvenirs, resulting in a maximum profit of 220 yuan.**Final Answer**1. The cost price of type ( A ) is boxed{20} yuan and type ( B ) is boxed{30} yuan.2. The store should purchase 30 pieces of type ( A ) and 10 pieces of type ( B ) to maximize the total profit, which is boxed{220} yuan."},{"question":"On the hyperbola frac{x^2}{1^2}-frac{y^2}{(2sqrt{2})^2}=1, the distance from a point P to one of the foci is 3. Find the distance from point P to the other focus.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a hyperbola. The equation given is (x¬≤/1¬≤) - (y¬≤/(2‚àö2)¬≤) = 1. Hmm, let me write that down properly: (x¬≤/1) - (y¬≤/(8)) = 1. So, it's a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening left and right along the x-axis.First, I remember that for hyperbolas, the standard form is (x¬≤/a¬≤) - (y¬≤/b¬≤) = 1, where 'a' is the distance from the center to each vertex, and 'b' is related to the conjugate axis. In this case, a¬≤ is 1, so a is 1, and b¬≤ is 8, so b is 2‚àö2. Got that.Now, hyperbolas have foci located at (¬±c, 0), where c¬≤ = a¬≤ + b¬≤. Let me calculate c. So, c¬≤ = 1 + 8 = 9, which means c is 3. So, the foci are at (3, 0) and (-3, 0). That makes sense.The problem says that the distance from a point P on the hyperbola to one of the foci is 3. I need to find the distance from P to the other focus. Hmm, okay.I recall that for hyperbolas, the difference of distances from any point on the hyperbola to the two foci is constant and equal to 2a. So, |PF1 - PF2| = 2a, where PF1 and PF2 are the distances from P to each focus. Since a is 1 here, the difference should be 2*1 = 2.So, if the distance from P to one focus is 3, then the distance to the other focus should be either 3 + 2 = 5 or 3 - 2 = 1. But wait, can the distance be 1? Let me think.Since the hyperbola is opening left and right, the two foci are on the x-axis at (3,0) and (-3,0). The point P is somewhere on the hyperbola. If P is on the right branch, it's closer to the right focus (3,0) and farther from the left focus (-3,0). Similarly, if P is on the left branch, it's closer to (-3,0) and farther from (3,0).But the hyperbola is symmetric, so regardless of which branch P is on, the difference in distances is 2a = 2.Wait, but if the distance to one focus is 3, then the distance to the other would be 3 ¬± 2. But we have to consider whether 3 - 2 = 1 is possible. Let me visualize.If P is on the right branch, it's closer to (3,0). So, the distance to (3,0) is 3, then the distance to (-3,0) would be 3 + 2 = 5. Alternatively, if P is on the left branch, the distance to (-3,0) is 3, then the distance to (3,0) would be 3 + 2 = 5. Wait, but if P is on the left branch, wouldn't it be closer to (-3,0)? So, the distance to (-3,0) would be less than the distance to (3,0). So, if the distance to (-3,0) is 3, then the distance to (3,0) would be 3 + 2 = 5.But hold on, if P is on the left branch, can the distance to (-3,0) be 3? Let me think about the minimum distance from a point on the left branch to the left focus.The left vertex is at (-1,0). The distance from (-1,0) to (-3,0) is 2. So, the minimum distance from any point on the left branch to (-3,0) is 2. So, if the distance is 3, that's more than the minimum, so it's possible. Similarly, on the right branch, the minimum distance to (3,0) is 2, so a distance of 3 is also possible.Wait, but if P is on the right branch, the distance to (3,0) is 3, which is more than the minimum distance of 2. So, that's fine. Then, the distance to the other focus would be 3 + 2 = 5. Alternatively, if P is on the left branch, the distance to (-3,0) is 3, so the distance to (3,0) is 3 + 2 = 5.Wait, but hold on. If P is on the right branch, the distance to (3,0) is 3, so the distance to (-3,0) is 3 + 2 = 5. If P is on the left branch, the distance to (-3,0) is 3, so the distance to (3,0) is 3 + 2 = 5. So, regardless of which branch P is on, the other distance is 5.But wait, is there a case where the distance is 3 - 2 = 1? Let me see. If P is on the right branch, the distance to (3,0) is 3, so the distance to (-3,0) is 3 + 2 = 5. If P is on the left branch, the distance to (-3,0) is 3, so the distance to (3,0) is 3 + 2 = 5. So, 1 is not possible because the minimum distance from a point on the hyperbola to a focus is 2 (from the vertex to the focus). So, if the distance is 3, which is more than 2, the other distance must be 5.Wait, but let me think again. If P is on the right branch, then PF1 - PF2 = 2a = 2. So, if PF1 is 3, then PF2 = PF1 - 2 = 1. But wait, PF2 is the distance to the other focus, which is (-3,0). But if P is on the right branch, can the distance to (-3,0) be 1? That would mean P is closer to (-3,0) than to (3,0), which isn't possible because P is on the right branch.Wait, maybe I got the definition wrong. Let me recall: for hyperbola, the absolute difference of distances is 2a. So, |PF1 - PF2| = 2a. So, if PF1 is 3, then PF2 could be 3 + 2 = 5 or 3 - 2 = 1. But in reality, depending on which branch P is on, one of these is valid.If P is on the right branch, then PF1 (distance to (3,0)) is greater than PF2 (distance to (-3,0)). Wait, no, actually, for hyperbola, it's the other way around. Wait, no, let me think.Wait, no, actually, for hyperbola, the definition is that the absolute difference is 2a. So, if P is on the right branch, then PF1 - PF2 = 2a, where PF1 is the distance to the right focus, and PF2 is the distance to the left focus. So, PF1 - PF2 = 2a = 2. So, if PF1 is 3, then PF2 = PF1 - 2 = 1. But wait, can PF2 be 1? Because the distance from P to (-3,0) is 1, but P is on the right branch, so the distance should be greater than the distance between the two foci minus something?Wait, maybe I'm confusing with ellipse. In ellipse, the sum is constant, but in hyperbola, it's the difference.Wait, let me think again. For hyperbola, the definition is |PF1 - PF2| = 2a. So, depending on which branch P is on, PF1 - PF2 is either 2a or -2a.So, if P is on the right branch, then PF1 - PF2 = 2a = 2. So, if PF1 is 3, then PF2 = 3 - 2 = 1. But is that possible? Because if P is on the right branch, it's supposed to be closer to (3,0) than to (-3,0). So, PF1 should be less than PF2? Wait, no, that's not correct.Wait, actually, if P is on the right branch, it's closer to (3,0), so PF1 is less than PF2. So, PF2 - PF1 = 2a = 2. So, if PF1 is 3, then PF2 = 3 + 2 = 5. That makes sense because P is on the right branch, so it's closer to (3,0), so the distance to (-3,0) is 5.Similarly, if P is on the left branch, then PF2 - PF1 = 2a = 2. So, if PF2 is 3, then PF1 = 3 - 2 = 1. But wait, if P is on the left branch, it's closer to (-3,0), so PF2 is less than PF1. So, PF1 - PF2 = 2a = 2. So, if PF2 is 3, then PF1 = 3 + 2 = 5. Wait, that seems conflicting.Wait, maybe I need to clarify. Let me denote F1 as (3,0) and F2 as (-3,0). For a point P on the right branch, the distance to F1 is less than the distance to F2. So, PF2 - PF1 = 2a = 2. So, if PF1 is 3, then PF2 = 3 + 2 = 5.For a point P on the left branch, the distance to F2 is less than the distance to F1. So, PF1 - PF2 = 2a = 2. So, if PF2 is 3, then PF1 = 3 + 2 = 5.Therefore, regardless of which branch P is on, if the distance to one focus is 3, the distance to the other is 5.Wait, but earlier I thought that if P is on the right branch, PF1 is 3, then PF2 is 5. If P is on the left branch, PF2 is 3, then PF1 is 5. So, in either case, the other distance is 5.But wait, is there a case where the distance is 1? Let me think. If P is on the right branch, and PF1 is 3, then PF2 is 5. If P is on the left branch, and PF2 is 3, then PF1 is 5. So, 1 is not possible because that would mean P is on the same side as the focus, but the distance is less than the minimum distance from the vertex to the focus.Wait, the vertex is at (1,0). The distance from (1,0) to (3,0) is 2. So, the minimum distance from any point on the right branch to (3,0) is 2. So, if PF1 is 3, which is more than 2, that's fine. Similarly, the minimum distance from any point on the left branch to (-3,0) is 2, so PF2 can't be less than 2. So, if PF2 is 3, that's fine, and PF1 is 5.So, in either case, the other distance is 5. Therefore, the answer is 5.But wait, let me double-check. Let me take a specific point on the hyperbola and see.Suppose P is on the right branch. Let me find a point where the distance to (3,0) is 3. So, let me set up the equations.Let P = (x, y) on the hyperbola, so x¬≤ - y¬≤/8 = 1.Distance from P to (3,0) is ‚àö[(x - 3)¬≤ + y¬≤] = 3.So, squaring both sides: (x - 3)¬≤ + y¬≤ = 9.But from the hyperbola equation, y¬≤ = 8(x¬≤ - 1).Substitute into the distance equation:(x - 3)¬≤ + 8(x¬≤ - 1) = 9.Expand (x - 3)¬≤: x¬≤ - 6x + 9.So, x¬≤ - 6x + 9 + 8x¬≤ - 8 = 9.Combine like terms: (1 + 8)x¬≤ + (-6x) + (9 - 8) = 9.So, 9x¬≤ - 6x + 1 = 9.Subtract 9: 9x¬≤ - 6x - 8 = 0.Quadratic equation: 9x¬≤ - 6x - 8 = 0.Solutions: x = [6 ¬± ‚àö(36 + 288)] / 18 = [6 ¬± ‚àö324]/18 = [6 ¬± 18]/18.So, x = (6 + 18)/18 = 24/18 = 4/3, or x = (6 - 18)/18 = (-12)/18 = -2/3.But since P is on the right branch, x must be ‚â• 1 or ‚â§ -1. So, x = 4/3 is valid, x = -2/3 is on the left branch.So, for x = 4/3, y¬≤ = 8((16/9) - 1) = 8(7/9) = 56/9, so y = ¬±(2‚àö14)/3.So, point P is (4/3, ¬±2‚àö14/3). Now, let's compute the distance to the other focus (-3,0).Distance = ‚àö[(4/3 + 3)¬≤ + (2‚àö14/3)^2] = ‚àö[(13/3)¬≤ + (28/9)].Compute (13/3)^2 = 169/9, and (2‚àö14/3)^2 = 4*14/9 = 56/9.So, total inside the sqrt: 169/9 + 56/9 = 225/9 = 25.So, distance is ‚àö25 = 5. So, that checks out.Similarly, if P is on the left branch, let's take x = -2/3, which is less than -1, so it's on the left branch.Compute y¬≤ = 8((4/9) - 1) = 8(-5/9) = -40/9. Wait, that can't be, because y¬≤ can't be negative. So, that's not possible. Wait, so x = -2/3 is not on the hyperbola? Wait, but from the quadratic, x = -2/3 is a solution, but when plugging back into the hyperbola equation, y¬≤ becomes negative, which is impossible. So, that suggests that x = -2/3 is not a valid point on the hyperbola. So, only x = 4/3 is valid.Wait, so does that mean that the only point where the distance to (3,0) is 3 is on the right branch? So, if P is on the left branch, can we have a point where the distance to (-3,0) is 3?Let me try that. Let P = (x, y) on the hyperbola, so x¬≤ - y¬≤/8 = 1.Distance from P to (-3,0) is ‚àö[(x + 3)^2 + y¬≤] = 3.Square both sides: (x + 3)^2 + y¬≤ = 9.From hyperbola equation, y¬≤ = 8(x¬≤ - 1).Substitute: (x + 3)^2 + 8(x¬≤ - 1) = 9.Expand (x + 3)^2: x¬≤ + 6x + 9.So, x¬≤ + 6x + 9 + 8x¬≤ - 8 = 9.Combine like terms: (1 + 8)x¬≤ + 6x + (9 - 8) = 9.So, 9x¬≤ + 6x + 1 = 9.Subtract 9: 9x¬≤ + 6x - 8 = 0.Quadratic equation: 9x¬≤ + 6x - 8 = 0.Solutions: x = [-6 ¬± ‚àö(36 + 288)] / 18 = [-6 ¬± ‚àö324]/18 = [-6 ¬± 18]/18.So, x = (-6 + 18)/18 = 12/18 = 2/3, or x = (-6 - 18)/18 = -24/18 = -4/3.Now, since P is on the left branch, x must be ‚â§ -1. So, x = -4/3 is valid, x = 2/3 is on the right branch.So, for x = -4/3, y¬≤ = 8((16/9) - 1) = 8(7/9) = 56/9, so y = ¬±(2‚àö14)/3.So, point P is (-4/3, ¬±2‚àö14/3). Now, let's compute the distance to the other focus (3,0).Distance = ‚àö[(-4/3 - 3)^2 + (2‚àö14/3)^2] = ‚àö[(-13/3)^2 + (28/9)].Compute (-13/3)^2 = 169/9, and (2‚àö14/3)^2 = 56/9.Total inside sqrt: 169/9 + 56/9 = 225/9 = 25.So, distance is ‚àö25 = 5. So, that also checks out.Wait, but when I tried x = -2/3 earlier, it didn't work because y¬≤ was negative. So, that suggests that for the left branch, the valid x is -4/3, which gives a valid y¬≤. So, in that case, the distance to the other focus is 5.So, regardless of whether P is on the right or left branch, if the distance to one focus is 3, the distance to the other is 5.Therefore, the answer is 5.**Final Answer**The distance from point ( P ) to the other focus is boxed{5}."},{"question":"Jonny climbed 1269 stairs last week.

If each person requires one seat and each seat is filled by one person, how many different rental combinations are possible?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where a school is organizing a trip for 482 people, and they need to rent buses. There are two types of buses available: 42-seater buses and 20-seater buses. Each person needs one seat, and each seat will be filled by one person. The question is asking how many different rental combinations are possible. Hmm, let me break this down. So, we need to find all the possible combinations of 42-seater buses and 20-seater buses that can accommodate exactly 482 people. That means if I let x be the number of 42-seater buses and y be the number of 20-seater buses, the equation would be:42x + 20y = 482And both x and y need to be non-negative integers because you can't rent a negative number of buses or a fraction of a bus. So, I need to find all pairs (x, y) where x and y are integers greater than or equal to zero that satisfy this equation.Alright, so how do I approach this? I think this is a linear Diophantine equation. The general form is ax + by = c, where a, b, and c are integers. In this case, a is 42, b is 20, and c is 482. I remember that to solve such equations, we can use the method of finding particular solutions and then finding the general solution.First, I should check if 42 and 20 have a common divisor that divides 482. Let me compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 42 and 20. Breaking down 42: 2 √ó 3 √ó 7Breaking down 20: 2¬≤ √ó 5So, the GCD is 2. Now, does 2 divide 482? Let's see, 482 divided by 2 is 241, which is an integer. So yes, the equation has solutions.Now, to find a particular solution, I can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. Let me try that.First, find the GCD of 42 and 20:42 divided by 20 is 2 with a remainder of 2 (since 20 √ó 2 = 40; 42 - 40 = 2).Now, take 20 divided by 2: that's 10 with a remainder of 0. So, the GCD is 2, as we found earlier.Now, working backwards to express 2 as a linear combination of 42 and 20:2 = 42 - 20 √ó 2So, 2 = 42 √ó 1 + 20 √ó (-2)Therefore, multiplying both sides by 241 (since 2 √ó 241 = 482):482 = 42 √ó 241 + 20 √ó (-482)Wait, that gives a particular solution where x = 241 and y = -482. But y can't be negative because we can't have a negative number of buses. So, that's not a valid solution for our problem.But since we're dealing with a Diophantine equation, the general solution can be written as:x = x0 + (20 / GCD) √ó t = 241 + 10ty = y0 - (42 / GCD) √ó t = -482 - 21tWhere t is an integer. But since x and y must be non-negative, we need to find all integer values of t such that both x and y are non-negative.So, let's write the inequalities:x = 241 + 10t ‚â• 0y = -482 - 21t ‚â• 0Starting with x:241 + 10t ‚â• 010t ‚â• -241t ‚â• -241 / 10t ‚â• -24.1Since t must be an integer, t ‚â• -24Now, for y:-482 - 21t ‚â• 0-21t ‚â• 482Multiplying both sides by -1 reverses the inequality:21t ‚â§ -482t ‚â§ -482 / 21Calculating that, 482 √∑ 21 is approximately 22.952. So, t ‚â§ -23 (since t must be an integer)So, t must satisfy both t ‚â• -24 and t ‚â§ -23. Therefore, t can be -24 or -23.Wait, let me check that:If t = -24:x = 241 + 10*(-24) = 241 - 240 = 1y = -482 -21*(-24) = -482 + 504 = 22So, x = 1, y = 22. Both are non-negative.If t = -23:x = 241 + 10*(-23) = 241 - 230 = 11y = -482 -21*(-23) = -482 + 483 = 1So, x = 11, y = 1. Both are non-negative.If t = -22:x = 241 + 10*(-22) = 241 - 220 = 21y = -482 -21*(-22) = -482 + 462 = -20Wait, y is negative here, which is not allowed. So, t cannot be -22.Similarly, t = -25:x = 241 + 10*(-25) = 241 - 250 = -9Which is negative, so that's invalid.So, the only valid t values are t = -24 and t = -23, giving us two solutions: (1, 22) and (11, 1).Wait, but that seems too few. Is that correct? Let me check my calculations again.Wait, in the general solution, I might have messed up the coefficients. Let me double-check.The general solution for the equation 42x + 20y = 482 is:x = x0 + (20 / GCD) * t = 241 + 10ty = y0 - (42 / GCD) * t = -482 -21tWait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the direction of the coefficients. Let me think again.The standard form is:x = x0 + (b / GCD) * ty = y0 - (a / GCD) * tWhere a = 42, b = 20, GCD = 2.So, yes, that would be:x = 241 + (20 / 2) * t = 241 + 10ty = -482 - (42 / 2) * t = -482 -21tSo, that part is correct.So, plugging t = -24:x = 241 + 10*(-24) = 241 - 240 = 1y = -482 -21*(-24) = -482 + 504 = 22Which is valid.t = -23:x = 241 + 10*(-23) = 241 - 230 = 11y = -482 -21*(-23) = -482 + 483 = 1Which is also valid.t = -22:x = 241 + 10*(-22) = 241 - 220 = 21y = -482 -21*(-22) = -482 + 462 = -20Which is invalid because y is negative.t = -25:x = 241 + 10*(-25) = 241 - 250 = -9Which is invalid because x is negative.So, indeed, only t = -24 and t = -23 give valid solutions. Therefore, there are only two possible combinations.Wait, but this seems counterintuitive because 42 and 20 are both even numbers, and 482 is also even, so maybe there are more solutions. Let me try another approach.Alternatively, maybe I can express the equation as:42x + 20y = 482Divide both sides by 2 to simplify:21x + 10y = 241Now, this is a simpler equation. So, 21x + 10y = 241We can solve for y in terms of x:10y = 241 - 21xy = (241 - 21x) / 10Since y must be an integer, (241 - 21x) must be divisible by 10. So, 241 - 21x ‚â° 0 mod 10.Which means:241 mod 10 = 121x mod 10 = (21 mod 10)x = 1x = xSo, 1 - x ‚â° 0 mod 10Which implies:x ‚â° 1 mod 10So, x can be written as x = 10k + 1, where k is a non-negative integer.Now, substituting back into the equation:21x + 10y = 24121*(10k + 1) + 10y = 241210k + 21 + 10y = 241210k + 10y = 220Divide both sides by 10:21k + y = 22So, y = 22 - 21kNow, since y must be non-negative, 22 - 21k ‚â• 0Which implies:21k ‚â§ 22k ‚â§ 22 / 21 ‚âà 1.047Since k is a non-negative integer, k can be 0 or 1.So, for k = 0:x = 10*0 + 1 = 1y = 22 - 21*0 = 22For k = 1:x = 10*1 + 1 = 11y = 22 - 21*1 = 1k = 2 would give y = 22 - 42 = -20, which is invalid.So, again, we get two solutions: (1, 22) and (11, 1). So, that confirms the earlier result.Therefore, there are only two possible combinations.Wait, but let me think again. Is there a way to have more solutions? Maybe I missed something.Wait, when I divided the original equation by 2, I got 21x + 10y = 241. Then, solving for y, I found that x must be congruent to 1 mod 10, so x = 10k + 1. Then, substituting back, I found y = 22 - 21k, which only allows k = 0 and 1.But let me check if there are other possible x values that could satisfy the condition that (241 - 21x) is divisible by 10.So, 241 - 21x ‚â° 0 mod 10Which is equivalent to 21x ‚â° 241 mod 10241 mod 10 is 1, and 21 mod 10 is 1, so:1*x ‚â° 1 mod 10Which simplifies to x ‚â° 1 mod 10So, x must be 1, 11, 21, 31, etc.But when x = 21:y = (241 - 21*21)/10 = (241 - 441)/10 = (-200)/10 = -20Which is negative, so invalid.Similarly, x = 31 would give y even more negative.So, indeed, only x = 1 and x = 11 are valid, giving y = 22 and y = 1 respectively.Therefore, there are only two possible combinations.Wait, but let me think again. Maybe I can approach this problem differently, perhaps by iterating through possible values of x and seeing if y comes out as an integer.So, starting with x = 0:42*0 + 20y = 482 ‚Üí 20y = 482 ‚Üí y = 24.1, which is not an integer.x = 1:42*1 + 20y = 482 ‚Üí 42 + 20y = 482 ‚Üí 20y = 440 ‚Üí y = 22. So, that's valid.x = 2:42*2 = 84 ‚Üí 482 - 84 = 398 ‚Üí 398 / 20 = 19.9, not integer.x = 3:42*3 = 126 ‚Üí 482 - 126 = 356 ‚Üí 356 / 20 = 17.8, not integer.x = 4:42*4 = 168 ‚Üí 482 - 168 = 314 ‚Üí 314 / 20 = 15.7, not integer.x = 5:42*5 = 210 ‚Üí 482 - 210 = 272 ‚Üí 272 / 20 = 13.6, not integer.x = 6:42*6 = 252 ‚Üí 482 - 252 = 230 ‚Üí 230 / 20 = 11.5, not integer.x = 7:42*7 = 294 ‚Üí 482 - 294 = 188 ‚Üí 188 / 20 = 9.4, not integer.x = 8:42*8 = 336 ‚Üí 482 - 336 = 146 ‚Üí 146 / 20 = 7.3, not integer.x = 9:42*9 = 378 ‚Üí 482 - 378 = 104 ‚Üí 104 / 20 = 5.2, not integer.x = 10:42*10 = 420 ‚Üí 482 - 420 = 62 ‚Üí 62 / 20 = 3.1, not integer.x = 11:42*11 = 462 ‚Üí 482 - 462 = 20 ‚Üí 20 / 20 = 1. So, y = 1, which is valid.x = 12:42*12 = 504 ‚Üí 504 > 482, so y would be negative, which is invalid.So, indeed, only x = 1 and x = 11 give integer values for y. Therefore, there are only two possible combinations.Wait, but I'm a bit confused because when I used the Diophantine approach, I only found two solutions, but when I think about the problem, maybe there are more solutions. Let me check again.Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial particular solution. Let me try to find another particular solution.We have 21x + 10y = 241Looking for integer solutions.Let me try x = 1:21*1 = 21 ‚Üí 241 -21 = 220 ‚Üí 220 /10 = 22. So, y = 22. That's the solution we found.x = 11:21*11 = 231 ‚Üí 241 -231 = 10 ‚Üí y = 1. That's the other solution.x = 21:21*21 = 441 ‚Üí 241 -441 = -200 ‚Üí y = -20, invalid.So, indeed, only x =1 and x=11 are valid.Wait, but maybe I can find another particular solution. Let me try x = 11:21*11 = 231, 241 -231 =10, so y=1.x=1: y=22.If I try x= -9:21*(-9) = -189, 241 - (-189)=430, y=430/10=43. But x can't be negative.So, no, that's not valid.So, it seems that only two solutions exist where both x and y are non-negative integers.Therefore, the number of different rental combinations possible is 2.Wait, but let me think again. Maybe I should consider that the problem is asking for the number of different rental combinations, which could include different numbers of buses, but perhaps I missed some solutions.Wait, perhaps I can represent the equation as:42x + 20y = 482We can write this as:21x + 10y = 241Looking for non-negative integers x and y.We can express this as:10y = 241 -21xSo, 241 -21x must be divisible by 10, and non-negative.So, 241 -21x ‚â• 0 ‚Üí 21x ‚â§ 241 ‚Üí x ‚â§ 241/21 ‚âà 11.476, so x can be from 0 to 11.Now, let's check for x from 0 to 11 whether 241 -21x is divisible by 10.x=0: 241 -0=241 ‚Üí 241/10=24.1 ‚Üí not integer.x=1: 241-21=220 ‚Üí 220/10=22 ‚Üí integer.x=2: 241-42=199 ‚Üí 199/10=19.9 ‚Üí not integer.x=3: 241-63=178 ‚Üí 178/10=17.8 ‚Üí not integer.x=4: 241-84=157 ‚Üí 157/10=15.7 ‚Üí not integer.x=5: 241-105=136 ‚Üí 136/10=13.6 ‚Üí not integer.x=6: 241-126=115 ‚Üí 115/10=11.5 ‚Üí not integer.x=7: 241-147=94 ‚Üí 94/10=9.4 ‚Üí not integer.x=8: 241-168=73 ‚Üí 73/10=7.3 ‚Üí not integer.x=9: 241-189=52 ‚Üí 52/10=5.2 ‚Üí not integer.x=10:241-210=31 ‚Üí31/10=3.1 ‚Üí not integer.x=11:241-231=10 ‚Üí10/10=1 ‚Üí integer.So, only x=1 and x=11 give integer y values. Therefore, only two solutions.Therefore, the number of different rental combinations is 2.Wait, but I'm still a bit unsure because sometimes when solving Diophantine equations, especially with two variables, there can be more solutions, but in this case, it seems only two.Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as a coin problem, where 42 and 20 are denominations, and 482 is the total amount. The number of ways to make 482 using 42 and 20.But in this case, since 42 and 20 are both even, and 482 is even, it's possible, but the number of solutions is limited.Wait, another way to think about it is to express y in terms of x:y = (482 -42x)/20We need y to be an integer ‚â•0.So, (482 -42x) must be divisible by 20, and non-negative.So, 482 -42x ‚â•0 ‚Üí x ‚â§482/42‚âà11.476, so x ‚â§11.Now, 482 mod 20 is 482 -20*24=482-480=2.So, 482 ‚â°2 mod20.Similarly, 42x mod20: 42‚â°2 mod20, so 42x‚â°2x mod20.So, 482 -42x ‚â°2 -2x mod20.We need 482 -42x ‚â°0 mod20, so:2 -2x ‚â°0 mod20 ‚Üí -2x ‚â°-2 mod20 ‚Üí 2x ‚â°2 mod20 ‚Üí x ‚â°1 mod10.So, x must be congruent to 1 mod10, i.e., x=10k+1, where k is integer ‚â•0.Now, since x ‚â§11, possible k values are k=0 and k=1.For k=0: x=1, y=(482-42*1)/20=(482-42)/20=440/20=22.For k=1: x=11, y=(482-42*11)/20=(482-462)/20=20/20=1.k=2 would give x=21, which is beyond the maximum x=11, so invalid.Thus, only two solutions.Therefore, the number of different rental combinations is 2.So, after checking through multiple methods‚Äîusing the Diophantine equation approach, simplifying the equation, checking possible x values, and using modular arithmetic‚Äîit consistently points to only two valid combinations: (1,22) and (11,1).Therefore, the answer should be 2.**Final Answer**The number of different rental combinations possible is boxed{2}."},{"question":"In a bag, there are 4 red balls and 6 white balls, all of the same size. Four balls are drawn from the bag.(1) If the balls drawn must include both colors, how many different combinations are there?(2) If the number of red balls drawn must be greater than or equal to the number of white balls drawn, how many different combinations are there?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about balls in a bag. There are 4 red balls and 6 white balls, all the same size. I need to draw four balls from the bag, and there are two different conditions to consider. Let me tackle each part step by step.Starting with part (1): If the balls drawn must include both colors, how many different combinations are there?Hmm, so I need to find the number of ways to draw four balls such that there's at least one red and at least one white ball. That means I can't have all four balls being red or all four being white. Since there are only 4 red balls, it's possible to draw all red, but there are 6 white balls, so it's also possible to draw all white. But in this case, we need to exclude those two scenarios.First, let me figure out the total number of ways to draw four balls without any restrictions. That would be the combination of 10 balls taken 4 at a time. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.So, total combinations = C(10, 4). Let me calculate that:10! / (4! * (10 - 4)!) = (10 * 9 * 8 * 7) / (4 * 3 * 2 * 1) = 210.Okay, so there are 210 total ways to draw four balls.Now, I need to subtract the cases where all four are red or all four are white.First, the number of ways to draw all red balls. There are 4 red balls, so we need to choose all 4. That's C(4, 4).C(4, 4) = 1. So, only one way to draw all red.Next, the number of ways to draw all white balls. There are 6 white balls, so we need to choose 4. That's C(6, 4).Calculating C(6, 4):6! / (4! * (6 - 4)!) = (6 * 5) / (2 * 1) = 15.So, there are 15 ways to draw all white balls.Therefore, the number of combinations that include both colors is total combinations minus all red minus all white.So, 210 - 1 - 15 = 194.Wait, let me double-check that. 210 total, subtract 1 for all red, subtract 15 for all white. 210 - 16 = 194. Yeah, that seems right.Alternatively, I could calculate it directly by considering the possible distributions of red and white balls.Since we need at least one red and at least one white, the possible cases are:1 red and 3 white,2 red and 2 white,3 red and 1 white.We can't have 4 red or 4 white because that would violate the \\"both colors\\" condition.So, let's compute each case:1 red and 3 white: C(4,1) * C(6,3).C(4,1) is 4, and C(6,3) is 20. So, 4 * 20 = 80.2 red and 2 white: C(4,2) * C(6,2).C(4,2) is 6, and C(6,2) is 15. So, 6 * 15 = 90.3 red and 1 white: C(4,3) * C(6,1).C(4,3) is 4, and C(6,1) is 6. So, 4 * 6 = 24.Adding these up: 80 + 90 + 24 = 194.Yep, same result. So, that confirms it. So, the answer to part (1) is 194.Moving on to part (2): If the number of red balls drawn must be greater than or equal to the number of white balls drawn, how many different combinations are there?Okay, so in this case, when we draw four balls, the number of red balls should be ‚â• the number of white balls. Since we're drawing four balls, let's think about the possible distributions.Let me denote r as the number of red balls and w as the number of white balls. So, r + w = 4, and we need r ‚â• w.Given that, let's find the possible values of r and w.Since r and w are non-negative integers, and r + w = 4, the possible pairs (r, w) are:(0,4), (1,3), (2,2), (3,1), (4,0).But we need r ‚â• w, so let's check which of these pairs satisfy that.For (0,4): r = 0, w = 4. 0 is not ‚â• 4. So, exclude.(1,3): r =1, w=3. 1 is not ‚â• 3. Exclude.(2,2): r=2, w=2. 2=2, so that's okay.(3,1): r=3, w=1. 3 ‚â•1, okay.(4,0): r=4, w=0. 4 ‚â•0, okay.So, the valid cases are (2,2), (3,1), and (4,0).Therefore, we need to compute the number of combinations for each of these cases and sum them up.Let's compute each case:Case 1: 2 red and 2 white.Number of ways: C(4,2) * C(6,2).C(4,2) is 6, and C(6,2) is 15. So, 6*15=90.Case 2: 3 red and 1 white.Number of ways: C(4,3) * C(6,1).C(4,3)=4, C(6,1)=6. So, 4*6=24.Case 3: 4 red and 0 white.Number of ways: C(4,4) * C(6,0).C(4,4)=1, C(6,0)=1. So, 1*1=1.Adding them up: 90 + 24 + 1 = 115.So, the total number of combinations is 115.Wait, let me verify this another way to make sure.Alternatively, since we have four balls, and the number of red balls must be at least the number of white balls, which in this case, since 4 is even, the condition r ‚â• w translates to r ‚â• 2, because if r=2, then w=2, which is equal, and if r=3 or 4, w=1 or 0, which still satisfies r ‚â• w.So, the number of combinations is the sum of C(4,2)*C(6,2) + C(4,3)*C(6,1) + C(4,4)*C(6,0). Which is exactly what I computed before: 90 +24 +1=115.Alternatively, another way to think about it is to calculate the total number of ways and subtract the cases where r < w.Total number of ways is C(10,4)=210.Number of cases where r < w: which would be the cases where r=0,1, or 2? Wait, no.Wait, in four balls, if r < w, then since r + w =4, w > r.So, for four balls, if w > r, then w must be at least 3, because if w=2, then r=2, which is equal, and w=1, r=3, which is r > w.Wait, actually, let's think about it.Wait, in four balls, if w > r, then since r + w =4, w must be at least 3, because if w=3, then r=1, which is w > r. If w=4, then r=0, which is also w > r.So, the cases where w > r are (r=0, w=4) and (r=1, w=3).So, the number of such combinations is C(4,0)*C(6,4) + C(4,1)*C(6,3).C(4,0)=1, C(6,4)=15, so 1*15=15.C(4,1)=4, C(6,3)=20, so 4*20=80.Total cases where w > r: 15 +80=95.Therefore, the number of cases where r ‚â• w is total combinations minus cases where w > r.So, 210 -95=115.Which is the same as before. So, that confirms the answer is 115.So, summarizing:Part (1): 194 combinations.Part (2): 115 combinations.**Final Answer**(1) The number of different combinations is boxed{194}.(2) The number of different combinations is boxed{115}."},{"question":"Let the sequence {a_n} be an arithmetic sequence with a non-zero common difference, and S_n be the sum of its first n terms.

First, the problem says that {a_n} is an arithmetic sequence with a non-zero common difference. That means each term increases by a constant amount, right? So, if the first term is a_1 and the common difference is d, then the nth term is a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d. Next, it mentions S_n, which is the sum of the first n terms. I remember the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence is S_n = n/2 * (2a_1 + (n-1)d) or sometimes written as S_n = n*(a_1 + a_n)/2. Both formulas are equivalent, so I can use whichever is more convenient.Now, the problem gives two conditions:1. a_1¬≤ + a_2¬≤ = a_3¬≤ + a_4¬≤2. S_5 = 5And we need to find the value of a_7.Alright, let's break this down. I'll start by writing expressions for each term using the arithmetic sequence formula.First, let's write out a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, and a_7 in terms of a_1 and d.- a_1 = a_1- a_2 = a_1 + d- a_3 = a_1 + 2d- a_4 = a_1 + 3d- a_7 = a_1 + 6dSo, a_7 is what we need to find, which is a_1 + 6d. So, if we can find a_1 and d, we can compute a_7.Now, let's look at the first condition: a_1¬≤ + a_2¬≤ = a_3¬≤ + a_4¬≤Let's substitute the expressions for a_2, a_3, and a_4 into this equation.So, substituting:a_1¬≤ + (a_1 + d)¬≤ = (a_1 + 2d)¬≤ + (a_1 + 3d)¬≤Let me expand each term step by step.First, expand a_1¬≤: that's just a_1¬≤.Next, expand (a_1 + d)¬≤: that's a_1¬≤ + 2a_1d + d¬≤.So, the left side becomes:a_1¬≤ + (a_1¬≤ + 2a_1d + d¬≤) = 2a_1¬≤ + 2a_1d + d¬≤Now, the right side: (a_1 + 2d)¬≤ + (a_1 + 3d)¬≤Let's expand each term:(a_1 + 2d)¬≤ = a_1¬≤ + 4a_1d + 4d¬≤(a_1 + 3d)¬≤ = a_1¬≤ + 6a_1d + 9d¬≤Adding these together:(a_1¬≤ + 4a_1d + 4d¬≤) + (a_1¬≤ + 6a_1d + 9d¬≤) = 2a_1¬≤ + 10a_1d + 13d¬≤So, putting it all together, the equation is:Left side: 2a_1¬≤ + 2a_1d + d¬≤Right side: 2a_1¬≤ + 10a_1d + 13d¬≤So, set them equal:2a_1¬≤ + 2a_1d + d¬≤ = 2a_1¬≤ + 10a_1d + 13d¬≤Hmm, let's subtract 2a_1¬≤ from both sides to simplify:2a_1d + d¬≤ = 10a_1d + 13d¬≤Now, let's bring all terms to one side:2a_1d + d¬≤ - 10a_1d - 13d¬≤ = 0Combine like terms:(2a_1d - 10a_1d) + (d¬≤ - 13d¬≤) = 0Which simplifies to:-8a_1d - 12d¬≤ = 0I can factor out a common term, which is -4d:-4d(2a_1 + 3d) = 0So, this equation gives us two possibilities:Either -4d = 0 or 2a_1 + 3d = 0But the problem states that the common difference d is non-zero, so -4d ‚â† 0. Therefore, we must have:2a_1 + 3d = 0So, 2a_1 = -3d => a_1 = (-3/2)dAlright, so that's one equation relating a_1 and d. Now, let's use the second condition: S_5 = 5We know that S_n = n/2 * (2a_1 + (n-1)d). So, for n=5:S_5 = 5/2 * (2a_1 + 4d) = 5Let me compute that:5/2 * (2a_1 + 4d) = 5Multiply both sides by 2/5 to simplify:(2a_1 + 4d) = (5)*(2/5) = 2So, 2a_1 + 4d = 2But from earlier, we have a_1 = (-3/2)d. Let me substitute that into this equation.So, 2*(-3/2)d + 4d = 2Compute each term:2*(-3/2)d = -3dSo, -3d + 4d = 2Simplify:( -3d + 4d ) = d = 2So, d = 2Now, since a_1 = (-3/2)d, substitute d=2:a_1 = (-3/2)*2 = -3So, a_1 = -3 and d = 2Therefore, a_7 = a_1 + 6d = -3 + 6*2 = -3 + 12 = 9Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.First, from the first condition, we had 2a_1 + 3d = 0, so a_1 = (-3/2)d. Then, using S_5 = 5:S_5 = 5/2*(2a_1 + 4d) = 5So, 2a_1 + 4d = 2Substituting a_1 = (-3/2)d:2*(-3/2)d + 4d = -3d + 4d = d = 2So, d=2, correct.Then, a_1 = (-3/2)*2 = -3, correct.So, a_7 = a_1 + 6d = -3 + 12 = 9, correct.Wait, but let me verify the first condition just to be thorough.Compute a_1¬≤ + a_2¬≤ and a_3¬≤ + a_4¬≤ with a_1=-3 and d=2.Compute a_1 = -3, a_2 = -3 + 2 = -1, a_3 = -3 + 4 = 1, a_4 = -3 + 6 = 3.So, a_1¬≤ + a_2¬≤ = (-3)^2 + (-1)^2 = 9 + 1 = 10a_3¬≤ + a_4¬≤ = (1)^2 + (3)^2 = 1 + 9 = 10Yes, that works. So, the first condition is satisfied.And S_5: Let's compute the sum of the first 5 terms.a_1 = -3, a_2 = -1, a_3 = 1, a_4 = 3, a_5 = 5Sum: (-3) + (-1) + 1 + 3 + 5 = (-4) + (1 + 3 + 5) = (-4) + 9 = 5Which matches the given condition. So, all checks out.Therefore, a_7 is 9.**Final Answer**The value of (a_7) is boxed{9}."},{"question":"Find the largest value of n such that 3x^2 +nx + 72 can be factored as the product of two linear factors with integer coefficients.","answer":"To determine the largest value of ( n ) for which the quadratic expression ( 3x^2 + nx + 72 ) can be factored into the product of two linear factors with integer coefficients, I'll start by expressing the quadratic in its factored form.
