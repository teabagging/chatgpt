The chairs were in demand and were being bought in a random order. At some point, a customer on the store's website discovered that only two chairs were left for sale. What is the probability that these two remaining chairs are of the same color?","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a furniture store that received a batch of office chairs. There are two colors: 15 black chairs and 18 brown chairs. So, in total, that's 15 + 18, which is 33 chairs. These chairs are being sold in a random order, and at some point, a customer notices that only two chairs are left. The question is asking for the probability that these two remaining chairs are of the same color.Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. Probability problems can sometimes be tricky, but breaking them down usually helps. So, the key here is that the chairs are being sold randomly, so each chair has an equal chance of being sold at any point. The customer sees that only two chairs are left, so we need to figure out the probability that both are black or both are brown.I think the best way to approach this is to consider the total number of chairs and how many are left. Since there are 33 chairs in total and two are left, that means 31 chairs have been sold. So, the problem reduces to finding the probability that the last two chairs are both black or both brown.Wait, another way to think about it is that the probability that the last two chairs are the same color is equal to the probability that the first 31 chairs sold include all chairs of one color except two. Hmm, maybe that's a bit more complicated. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to think about the possible combinations of the remaining two chairs.Let me recall that when dealing with probabilities involving combinations, the formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k! (n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items we're choosing. So, in this case, the total number of ways to choose 2 chairs out of 33 is C(33, 2). Then, the number of ways to choose 2 black chairs is C(15, 2), and the number of ways to choose 2 brown chairs is C(18, 2). So, the probability that both remaining chairs are the same color would be [C(15, 2) + C(18, 2)] divided by C(33, 2).Let me write that down:Probability = [C(15, 2) + C(18, 2)] / C(33, 2)Calculating each combination:C(15, 2) = 15! / (2! * 13!) = (15 * 14) / (2 * 1) = 105C(18, 2) = 18! / (2! * 16!) = (18 * 17) / (2 * 1) = 153C(33, 2) = 33! / (2! * 31!) = (33 * 32) / (2 * 1) = 528So, plugging these numbers back into the probability formula:Probability = (105 + 153) / 528 = 258 / 528Now, let's simplify that fraction. Both numerator and denominator are divisible by 6.258 √∑ 6 = 43528 √∑ 6 = 88So, that simplifies to 43/88.Wait, is 43 a prime number? Let me check. 43 divided by 2 is not whole, 43 divided by 3 is not, 5, 7, 11... up to sqrt(43) which is about 6.5, so yes, 43 is prime. So, the fraction can't be simplified further.Therefore, the probability is 43/88.But hold on, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in my reasoning. Another way to think about this is using probability step by step.Imagine the chairs are being sold one by one. The probability that the first chair sold is black is 15/33. Then, the probability that the second chair is also black is 14/32, and so on. But that seems more complicated because we have to consider all possible orders.Alternatively, since the chairs are being sold randomly, the probability that the last two chairs are both black is the same as the probability that any two specific chairs are both black. Similarly for brown.So, the probability that the last two chairs are both black is C(15, 2)/C(33, 2), and the probability that they are both brown is C(18, 2)/C(33, 2). Adding these together gives the total probability.Yes, that seems consistent with my earlier calculation.Wait, another thought: sometimes when dealing with probabilities involving the last few items, it's equivalent to considering the probability that the first few items are of a certain type. Because the order is random, the probability should be the same whether we're looking at the first two chairs or the last two chairs.So, in this case, the probability that the first two chairs sold are both black is (15/33)*(14/32). Similarly, the probability that the first two chairs sold are both brown is (18/33)*(17/32). Then, adding these together gives the probability that the first two chairs are the same color, which is the same as the probability that the last two chairs are the same color.Let me compute that:Probability both black: (15/33)*(14/32) = (15*14)/(33*32) = 210/1056Probability both brown: (18/33)*(17/32) = (18*17)/(33*32) = 306/1056Adding these together: 210 + 306 = 516; so 516/1056Simplify this fraction: divide numerator and denominator by 12.516 √∑ 12 = 431056 √∑ 12 = 88So, again, we get 43/88.Okay, so that confirms my earlier result. So, the probability is 43/88.Just to make sure, let me think of another approach. Maybe using permutations instead of combinations.The total number of ways to arrange the chairs is 33!. The number of ways where the last two chairs are both black: we can arrange the first 31 chairs with all 15 black chairs except two, so that would be arranging 13 black chairs and 18 brown chairs in the first 31 positions. The number of such arrangements is 31! / (13! 18!). Similarly, for the last two chairs being brown, it's arranging 15 black chairs and 16 brown chairs in the first 31 positions, which is 31! / (15! 16!). So, the total number of favorable arrangements is [31! / (13! 18!)] + [31! / (15! 16!)].The total number of possible arrangements is 33!.So, the probability is [31! / (13! 18!) + 31! / (15! 16!)] / 33!Simplify this:Factor out 31!:31! [1/(13! 18!) + 1/(15! 16!)] / (33 * 32 * 31!)The 31! cancels out:[1/(13! 18!) + 1/(15! 16!)] / (33 * 32)Compute each term:1/(13! 18!) = 1 / (13! * 18!) = 1 / (13! * 18!) Similarly, 1/(15! 16!) = 1 / (15! * 16!) But to compute this, maybe we can express it in terms of combinations.Wait, 1/(13! 18!) is equal to 1 / (C(31,13) * 13! * 18!) Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the numerical values.Wait, 1/(13! 18!) is equal to 1 / (6227020800 * 6402373705728000) which is an extremely small number, but that's not helpful.Wait, maybe I should think differently. Let me express 1/(13! 18!) as C(31,13) / 31! because C(31,13) = 31! / (13! 18!). Similarly, 1/(15! 16!) = C(31,15) / 31!.So, substituting back:[ C(31,13) / 31! + C(31,15) / 31! ] / (33 * 32)Which is [ (C(31,13) + C(31,15)) / 31! ] / (33 * 32)But C(31,13) + C(31,15) is equal to C(32,14) due to the identity C(n, k) + C(n, k+2) = C(n+1, k+1). Wait, actually, the identity is C(n, k) + C(n, k+1) = C(n+1, k+1). So, maybe that's not directly applicable here.Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute C(31,13) and C(31,15) separately.But this seems getting too complicated, and since I already have two methods giving me 43/88, I think this third approach is unnecessary unless I suspect an error in the first two.But just to be thorough, let me compute C(31,13) and C(31,15):C(31,13) = 31! / (13! 18!) C(31,15) = 31! / (15! 16!) So, adding them together:C(31,13) + C(31,15) = 31! [1/(13! 18!) + 1/(15! 16!)] So, when we divide by 31!, we get back to the same expression as before. So, this approach is not simplifying things.Alternatively, maybe I can factor out terms:1/(13! 18!) + 1/(15! 16!) = [15! 16! + 13! 18!] / (13! 15! 16! 18!) But that seems even more complicated.I think I'm overcomplicating this. Since the first two methods gave me the same answer, 43/88, and they are both valid, I can be confident that the probability is indeed 43/88.Just to recap:Method 1: Using combinations, the number of ways to choose 2 chairs of the same color divided by the total number of ways to choose any 2 chairs.Method 2: Considering the probability step by step, calculating the probability that the first two chairs are both black or both brown, which is equivalent due to the random order.Both methods led to the same result, so I think that's solid.Therefore, the probability that the two remaining chairs are of the same color is 43/88.**Final Answer**The probability that the two remaining chairs are of the same color is boxed{dfrac{43}{88}}."},{"question":"Ruda received an alarm clock for his birthday. He was happy with it and set it to the exact time. Since then, every morning when he woke up (including Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays), he pressed the button that lights up the dial for exactly 4 seconds. During the time the button was pressed, the clock stopped. Otherwise, the clock neither gained nor lost time. On the afternoon of December 11, Ruda checked his clock and found that it was exactly 3 minutes behind the correct time.When did Ruda receive this alarm clock?Hint: How many times did Ruda press the button?","answer":"Okay, so I need to figure out when Ruda received his alarm clock. Let me try to break down the problem step by step.First, Ruda got an alarm clock for his birthday. He set it to the exact time, so initially, the clock was accurate. Every morning when he wakes up, including weekends and holidays, he presses a button that lights up the dial for exactly 4 seconds. During those 4 seconds, the clock stops. Otherwise, the clock keeps accurate time‚Äîit neither gains nor loses time.On the afternoon of December 11, Ruda checked his clock and found that it was exactly 3 minutes behind the correct time. So, the clock has lost 3 minutes in total. I need to find out how many days have passed since he received the clock, and then figure out the date he received it.Let me think about how the clock loses time. Each time Ruda presses the button, the clock stops for 4 seconds. So, every press causes the clock to lose 4 seconds. Therefore, the total time lost is equal to the number of presses multiplied by 4 seconds.Given that the clock is 3 minutes behind, which is 180 seconds, I can set up an equation:Number of presses √ó 4 seconds = 180 secondsSo, Number of presses = 180 / 4 = 45 presses.Therefore, Ruda must have pressed the button 45 times since he received the clock. Since he presses the button every morning, that means 45 days have passed since he received the clock.Now, I need to find out what date is 45 days before December 11. Let me work backward from December 11.First, December has 31 days, so from December 11, going back 11 days would take us to November 30. Then, we have 45 - 11 = 34 days left to go back into November.November has 30 days, so going back 30 days from November 30 would take us to October 31. Then, we have 34 - 30 = 4 days left to go back into October.So, going back 4 days from October 31 would be October 27.Wait, let me verify that:Starting from December 11:- Subtract 11 days: December 11 - 11 days = November 30- Subtract 30 days: November 30 - 30 days = October 31- Subtract 4 days: October 31 - 4 days = October 27Yes, that seems correct.So, 45 days before December 11 is October 27. Therefore, Ruda received the alarm clock on October 27.But wait, let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when counting days, it's easy to make an off-by-one error.Starting from October 27:- October has 31 days, so from October 27 to October 31 is 4 days.- Then, November has 30 days, so from November 1 to November 30 is 30 days.- Then, from December 1 to December 11 is 11 days.Adding them up: 4 + 30 + 11 = 45 days. Perfect, that matches.Therefore, Ruda received the alarm clock on October 27.But wait, hold on. The problem says that on the afternoon of December 11, the clock was 3 minutes behind. So, does that mean the last press was on the morning of December 11? Because he presses the button every morning, so the last press would be on the morning of December 11, which would cause the clock to stop for 4 seconds that morning.Therefore, the total number of presses is 45, which includes the press on December 11. So, the first press was on October 27, and the last press was on December 11, totaling 45 days.Wait, but if he received the clock on October 27, then the first press would be on October 28, right? Because he received it on his birthday, set it, and then starting the next morning, he pressed the button.So, let me clarify: If he received the clock on October 27, then the first press was on October 28. Therefore, the number of days between October 28 and December 11 inclusive is 45 days.Wait, let's calculate the days from October 28 to December 11.October: 31 - 28 = 3 days remaining in October (October 28, 29, 30, 31) ‚Äì that's 4 days.November: 30 days.December: 11 days.Total: 4 + 30 + 11 = 45 days. So, starting from October 28, pressing every day, including December 11, would result in 45 presses.Therefore, the first press was on October 28, meaning he received the clock on October 27.Hence, Ruda received the alarm clock on October 27.Wait, but hang on. If he received the clock on October 27, he set it to the exact time, and the next morning, October 28, he pressed the button for the first time. So, the total number of presses is 45, which would be from October 28 to December 11 inclusive.So, the number of days between October 28 and December 11 is 45 days, which is correct.Therefore, the date he received the clock is October 27.But let me cross-verify once more.If he received the clock on October 27, then:- October 27: received, set to correct time.- October 28: first press, clock stops for 4 seconds.- Each subsequent morning: another press, another 4 seconds lost.- On December 11 afternoon: total loss is 3 minutes, which is 45 presses √ó 4 seconds = 180 seconds = 3 minutes.Yes, that adds up.Therefore, the answer is October 27.But wait, hold on. Let me make sure about the number of days between October 28 and December 11.From October 28 to October 31: that's 4 days (28, 29, 30, 31).From November 1 to November 30: 30 days.From December 1 to December 11: 11 days.Total: 4 + 30 + 11 = 45 days. So, 45 presses, each causing 4 seconds loss, totaling 180 seconds, which is 3 minutes. Perfect.Therefore, Ruda received the clock on October 27.I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning.**Final Answer**Ruda received the alarm clock on boxed{October 27}."},{"question":"Abe can paint the room in 15 hours, Bea can paint 50 percent faster than Abe, and Coe can paint twice as fast as Abe. Abe begins to paint the room and works alone for the first hour and a half. Then Bea joins Abe, and they work together until half the room is painted. Then Coe joins Abe and Bea, and they work together until the entire room is painted. Find the number of minutes after Abe begins for the three of them to finish painting the room.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about Abe, Bea, and Coe painting a room. Let me try to break it down step by step. I need to find the total time it takes from when Abe starts painting until the room is completely finished. The answer should be in minutes, so I'll have to convert hours to minutes at the end.First, let me figure out how fast each person can paint the room individually. The problem says Abe can paint the room in 15 hours. So, Abe's painting rate is 1 room per 15 hours, which I can write as:Abe's rate = 1/15 rooms per hour.Next, Bea can paint 50% faster than Abe. Hmm, 50% faster means her rate is Abe's rate plus half of Abe's rate. So, let me calculate that:Bea's rate = Abe's rate + 0.5 * Abe's rate= (1/15) + 0.5*(1/15)= (1/15) + (1/30)= (2/30) + (1/30)= 3/30= 1/10 rooms per hour.Wait, that seems right. So Bea can paint 1/10 of the room each hour.Now, Coe can paint twice as fast as Abe. So Coe's rate is twice Abe's rate:Coe's rate = 2 * (1/15)= 2/15 rooms per hour.Got it. So Coe paints 2/15 of the room each hour.Now, let me outline the timeline of the painting process:1. Abe works alone for the first 1.5 hours.2. Then Bea joins Abe, and they work together until half the room is painted.3. Then Coe joins Abe and Bea, and they work together until the entire room is painted.Wait, hold on. The problem says: \\"Abe begins to paint the room and works alone for the first hour and a half. Then Bea joins Abe, and they work together until half the room is painted. Then Coe joins Abe and Bea, and they work together until the entire room is painted.\\"Wait, so after Abe works alone for 1.5 hours, Bea joins him, and they work together until half the room is painted. Then Coe joins them, and they finish the remaining half. Hmm, that seems a bit confusing. Let me parse this again.Wait, maybe it's not that they work until half the room is painted, but rather until half the remaining room is painted? Or perhaps the problem is structured as:- Abe works alone for 1.5 hours, painting some portion of the room.- Then, Bea joins Abe, and together they work until half the room is painted. So, if after Abe's initial work, the remaining work is more than half, then Bea and Abe work until the total painted area reaches half the room.Wait, that might not make sense because if Abe has already painted some, adding more painters would make the total painted area go beyond half. Maybe I need to think differently.Wait, perhaps the problem is that after Abe works alone for 1.5 hours, Bea joins him, and they work together until half the room is painted. So, the total painted area when Bea joins is some amount, and then they work together until the total painted area is half. Then Coe joins, and they work until the entire room is painted.Wait, perhaps the problem is structured as:1. Abe paints alone for 1.5 hours.2. Then, Abe and Bea paint together until half the room is painted.3. Then, Abe, Bea, and Coe paint together until the entire room is painted.Wait, but that might not make sense because if they are already painting until half the room is painted, then adding Coe would just speed up the process for the remaining half.Wait, maybe I should model the amount of work done at each stage.Let me denote the total work as 1 room.First, Abe works alone for 1.5 hours. His rate is 1/15 per hour, so in 1.5 hours, he paints:Work done by Abe alone = (1/15) * 1.5 = (1/15)*(3/2) = 3/30 = 1/10.So, after 1.5 hours, 1/10 of the room is painted.Then, Bea joins Abe, so now both are working together. Their combined rate is Abe's rate plus Bea's rate:Abe + Bea = 1/15 + 1/10.Let me compute that:1/15 + 1/10 = (2/30 + 3/30) = 5/30 = 1/6 rooms per hour.So together, they paint 1/6 of the room each hour.Now, the problem says they work together until half the room is painted. Wait, does that mean until the total painted area is half, or until they paint half of the remaining area?Wait, the problem says: \\"they work together until half the room is painted.\\" So, I think it means until the total painted area is half the room. So, after Abe's initial 1.5 hours, 1/10 is painted. Then, Abe and Bea work together until the total painted area is 1/2.So, the amount they need to paint together is 1/2 - 1/10 = 5/10 - 1/10 = 4/10 = 2/5.So, they need to paint 2/5 of the room together at a rate of 1/6 per hour.Time taken for this stage is (2/5) / (1/6) = (2/5)*(6/1) = 12/5 = 2.4 hours.Wait, 2.4 hours is 2 hours and 24 minutes. Hmm, that seems a bit long, but let's go with it for now.So, after this second stage, the total time elapsed is 1.5 hours + 2.4 hours = 3.9 hours.At this point, half the room is painted, so the remaining work is 1 - 1/2 = 1/2.Then, Coe joins Abe and Bea, so now all three are working together. Their combined rate is Abe + Bea + Coe:Abe: 1/15Bea: 1/10Coe: 2/15Total rate = 1/15 + 1/10 + 2/15.Let me compute that:Convert to 30 denominator:1/15 = 2/301/10 = 3/302/15 = 4/30So, total rate = 2/30 + 3/30 + 4/30 = 9/30 = 3/10 rooms per hour.So, together, they can paint 3/10 of the room each hour.The remaining work is 1/2, so time taken for this stage is (1/2) / (3/10) = (1/2)*(10/3) = 10/6 = 5/3 ‚âà 1.6667 hours, which is 1 hour and 40 minutes.Therefore, total time is 1.5 hours + 2.4 hours + 1.6667 hours.Let me compute that:1.5 + 2.4 = 3.93.9 + 1.6667 ‚âà 5.5667 hours.Convert 5.5667 hours to minutes: 5 hours is 300 minutes, 0.5667 hours is approximately 0.5667 * 60 ‚âà 34 minutes.So total time is approximately 334 minutes.Wait, but let me check my calculations again because 5.5667 hours is 5 hours and 34 minutes, which is 334 minutes.But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the second stage.Wait, in the second stage, after Abe paints 1/10, they work together until half the room is painted. So, the amount they need to paint together is 1/2 - 1/10 = 4/10 = 2/5.Their combined rate is 1/6 per hour, so time is (2/5)/(1/6) = 12/5 = 2.4 hours, which is correct.Then, in the third stage, they have 1/2 left, and their combined rate is 3/10 per hour, so time is (1/2)/(3/10) = 5/3 hours, which is 1 hour and 40 minutes.So total time is 1.5 + 2.4 + 1.6667 = 5.5667 hours, which is 5 hours and 34 minutes, or 334 minutes.Wait, but let me think again. The problem says \\"they work together until half the room is painted.\\" Does that mean until half the room is painted in total, or until they paint half of the remaining room?Wait, if it's until half the room is painted in total, then my calculation is correct. But if it's until they paint half of the remaining room, then the calculation would be different.Wait, let me re-examine the problem statement:\\"Abe begins to paint the room and works alone for the first hour and a half. Then Bea joins Abe, and they work together until half the room is painted. Then Coe joins Abe and Bea, and they work together until the entire room is painted.\\"So, the wording is \\"until half the room is painted.\\" So, I think it refers to the total painted area reaching half the room. So, after Abe's initial work, they continue until the total is half, then Coe joins to finish the remaining half.So, my initial calculation seems correct.But let me verify the time taken in each stage.First stage: 1.5 hours, Abe paints 1/10.Second stage: Abe and Bea together paint 2/5 of the room at 1/6 per hour, taking 12/5 = 2.4 hours.Third stage: All three paint 1/2 of the room at 3/10 per hour, taking 5/3 hours.Total time: 1.5 + 2.4 + 1.6667 = 5.5667 hours.Wait, 5.5667 hours is 5 hours and 0.5667*60 ‚âà 34 minutes, so 5 hours 34 minutes, which is 334 minutes.But let me check if the second stage is correct. Because after Abe paints 1/10, they need to reach 1/2, so 4/10 more. At a rate of 1/6 per hour, time is 4/10 divided by 1/6, which is 4/10 * 6/1 = 24/10 = 2.4 hours. That's correct.Then, the third stage is 1/2 room left, at 3/10 per hour, so 1/2 divided by 3/10 is 5/3 hours, which is 1 hour 40 minutes. So total time is 1.5 + 2.4 + 1.6667 = 5.5667 hours, which is 5 hours 34 minutes, so 334 minutes.Wait, but let me check if the problem says \\"until half the room is painted\\" after Bea joins. So, perhaps the initial 1.5 hours is 1/10, then Bea joins and they work until the total is half, which is 1/2. So, the amount they paint together is 1/2 - 1/10 = 4/10, which is 2/5, as I had before.So, 2/5 divided by their combined rate of 1/6 per hour is 12/5 hours, which is 2.4 hours.Then, the remaining 1/2 is painted by all three at 3/10 per hour, taking 5/3 hours.So, total time is 1.5 + 2.4 + 1.6667 ‚âà 5.5667 hours, which is 334 minutes.Wait, but let me think again. When they say \\"they work together until half the room is painted,\\" does that mean until half of the remaining room is painted, or until the total painted area is half? Because if it's half of the remaining room, then the calculation would be different.Wait, the problem says \\"they work together until half the room is painted.\\" So, I think it's referring to half the entire room, not half of the remaining. So, my initial calculation is correct.But just to be thorough, let's consider the alternative interpretation.Alternative interpretation: After Abe works alone for 1.5 hours, painting 1/10, then Bea joins, and they work together until half of the remaining room is painted. The remaining room after Abe's work is 9/10. Half of that is 9/20. So, they need to paint 9/20 of the room together.Their combined rate is 1/6 per hour, so time is (9/20)/(1/6) = (9/20)*(6/1) = 54/20 = 2.7 hours.Then, after that, the remaining room is 9/10 - 9/20 = 9/10 - 4.5/10 = 4.5/10 = 9/20.Then, Coe joins, and all three paint together at 3/10 per hour. So, time is (9/20)/(3/10) = (9/20)*(10/3) = 90/60 = 1.5 hours.Total time would be 1.5 + 2.7 + 1.5 = 5.7 hours, which is 5 hours 42 minutes, or 342 minutes.But the problem says \\"until half the room is painted,\\" which I think refers to half of the entire room, not half of the remaining. So, I think the first interpretation is correct, giving 334 minutes.Wait, but let me check the problem statement again:\\"Abe can paint the room in 15 hours, Bea can paint 50 percent faster than Abe, and Coe can paint twice as fast as Abe. Abe begins to paint the room and works alone for the first hour and a half. Then Bea joins Abe, and they work together until half the room is painted. Then Coe joins Abe and Bea, and they work together until the entire room is painted.\\"So, the key phrase is \\"until half the room is painted.\\" It doesn't specify \\"half of the remaining room,\\" so I think it's referring to half of the entire room.Therefore, the correct total time is 5.5667 hours, which is 334 minutes.Wait, but let me do the calculation again step by step to make sure.First stage: Abe alone for 1.5 hours.Abe's rate: 1/15 per hour.Work done: 1.5 * (1/15) = 0.1, which is 1/10.So, after 1.5 hours, 1/10 painted.Second stage: Abe and Bea together until total painted is 1/2.Amount to paint: 1/2 - 1/10 = 4/10 = 2/5.Combined rate: 1/15 + 1/10 = (2 + 3)/30 = 5/30 = 1/6 per hour.Time: (2/5) / (1/6) = (2/5)*(6/1) = 12/5 = 2.4 hours.So, after 2.4 hours, total time is 1.5 + 2.4 = 3.9 hours.At this point, 1/2 painted.Third stage: All three together until entire room is painted.Remaining work: 1 - 1/2 = 1/2.Combined rate: 1/15 + 1/10 + 2/15.Convert to common denominator 30:1/15 = 2/301/10 = 3/302/15 = 4/30Total: 2 + 3 + 4 = 9/30 = 3/10 per hour.Time: (1/2) / (3/10) = (1/2)*(10/3) = 10/6 = 5/3 ‚âà 1.6667 hours.Total time: 1.5 + 2.4 + 1.6667 ‚âà 5.5667 hours.Convert to minutes: 5 hours is 300 minutes, 0.5667 hours is 0.5667*60 ‚âà 34 minutes. So total is 334 minutes.Wait, but let me check if 5.5667 hours is exactly 5 and 5/9 hours, because 0.5667 is approximately 5/9.Wait, 5/9 hours is approximately 0.5556 hours, which is 33.333 minutes. Hmm, but 5.5667 is 5 + 0.5667, which is 5 + 34/60, which is 5 + 17/30 hours.Wait, perhaps I should represent it as fractions to get an exact value.Let me compute the total time as fractions.First stage: 1.5 hours = 3/2 hours.Second stage: 12/5 hours.Third stage: 5/3 hours.Total time: 3/2 + 12/5 + 5/3.To add these, find a common denominator. The denominators are 2, 5, 3. The least common multiple is 30.Convert each fraction:3/2 = 45/3012/5 = 72/305/3 = 50/30Total: 45 + 72 + 50 = 167/30 hours.167 divided by 30 is 5 and 17/30 hours.Convert 17/30 hours to minutes: 17/30 * 60 = 34 minutes.So total time is 5 hours and 34 minutes, which is 5*60 + 34 = 300 + 34 = 334 minutes.So, the answer is 334 minutes.Wait, but let me just make sure that in the second stage, they are indeed painting until the total is half, not until they've painted half of the remaining.Because if it's half of the remaining, the calculation would be different, but as per the problem statement, it's until half the room is painted, which I think refers to the total.Therefore, I think 334 minutes is the correct answer.**Final Answer**The total time taken to paint the room is boxed{334} minutes."},{"question":"Every bundle of hay that Lucas harvests gives him 50 bales of hay. If he feeds his horses 3 bales a day from March 1 through October 31, how many bundles of hay will he need to harvest?","answer":"First, I need to determine the number of days Lucas feeds his horses. The feeding period starts on March 1 and ends on October 31. I'll calculate the number of days in each month from March to October.March has 31 days, April has 30, May has 31, June has 30, July has 31, August has 31, September has 30, and October has 31 days. Adding these together gives a total of 243 days.Next, Lucas feeds his horses 3 bales of hay each day. Multiplying the number of days by the daily consumption: 243 days * 3 bales/day = 729 bales.Each bundle of hay provides 50 bales. To find out how many bundles Lucas needs, I'll divide the total bales by the number of bales per bundle: 729 bales / 50 bales/bundle = 14.58 bundles.Since Lucas can't harvest a fraction of a bundle, he'll need to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, Lucas needs to harvest 15 bundles of hay."},{"question":"Emily purchased notebooks for her four friends. Each friend received 25 small notebooks and 17 large notebooks.

How many notebooks will each friend get now?","answer":"First, I need to calculate the total number of notebooks Emily purchased. Each of her four friends received 25 small notebooks and 17 large notebooks.So, for small notebooks: 4 friends √ó 25 small notebooks = 100 small notebooks.For large notebooks: 4 friends √ó 17 large notebooks = 68 large notebooks.Adding these together gives the total number of notebooks: 100 + 68 = 168 notebooks.Next, I'll determine how many notebooks were used in total.

Enter these solutions, separated by commas.","answer":"Okay, so I have this equation: (x^4 - 3x^3 + 5x^2 - 27x - 36 = 0). The problem says that two of its solutions are pure imaginary. Hmm, pure imaginary numbers are numbers like (bi) where (b) is a real number and (i) is the imaginary unit. So, they have no real part. That means if (bi) is a solution, then its complex conjugate (-bi) should also be a solution, right? Because for polynomials with real coefficients, complex roots come in conjugate pairs.So, if two of the roots are pure imaginary, say (ki) and (-ki), then the polynomial can be factored as ((x - ki)(x + ki)(quadratic)). Let me write that down: ((x^2 + k^2)(quadratic) = 0). So, the quartic can be factored into a quadratic times another quadratic.Maybe I can factor the quartic into two quadratics. Let me try to factor it as ((x^2 + ax + b)(x^2 + cx + d)). Expanding this, I get:(x^4 + (a + c)x^3 + (ac + b + d)x^2 + (ad + bc)x + bd).Now, let's compare this with the given polynomial: (x^4 - 3x^3 + 5x^2 - 27x - 36).So, setting up equations based on coefficients:1. (a + c = -3) (from the (x^3) term)2. (ac + b + d = 5) (from the (x^2) term)3. (ad + bc = -27) (from the (x) term)4. (bd = -36) (from the constant term)Hmm, okay, so we have four equations with four unknowns: (a), (c), (b), (d). Let me see if I can find integer solutions for these.Starting with equation 4: (bd = -36). So, possible integer pairs for (b) and (d) are:(1, -36), (-1, 36), (2, -18), (-2, 18), (3, -12), (-3, 12), (4, -9), (-4, 9), (6, -6), (-6, 6), (9, -4), (-9, 4), (12, -3), (-12, 3), (18, -2), (-18, 2), (36, -1), (-36, 1).That's a lot of possibilities. Maybe I can find some that satisfy the other equations.Looking at equation 3: (ad + bc = -27). Let me think about how to approach this. Maybe I can assume some values for (b) and (d) and see if equations 1, 2, and 3 can be satisfied.Alternatively, since we know that two roots are pure imaginary, the quadratic factor with those roots is (x^2 + k^2). So, maybe one of the quadratics in the factorization is (x^2 + k^2), which would mean that either (b = k^2) and (a = 0), or (d = k^2) and (c = 0). Wait, but in the factorization I assumed both quadratics have linear terms. Hmm.Wait, if one of the quadratics is (x^2 + k^2), then that would mean that in the factorization ((x^2 + k^2)(x^2 + px + q)), the coefficients would be:(x^4 + px^3 + (q + k^2)x^2 + pk^2x + qk^2).Comparing to the original polynomial:1. Coefficient of (x^3): (p = -3)2. Coefficient of (x^2): (q + k^2 = 5)3. Coefficient of (x): (pk^2 = -27)4. Constant term: (qk^2 = -36)So, from equation 1, (p = -3). Then, equation 3: (-3k^2 = -27), so (k^2 = 9), which means (k = 3) or (k = -3). Since (k^2) is positive, it doesn't matter. So, (k^2 = 9).Then, equation 2: (q + 9 = 5), so (q = 5 - 9 = -4).Equation 4: (qk^2 = -4 * 9 = -36), which matches the constant term. Perfect!So, that means the quartic factors as ((x^2 + 9)(x^2 - 3x - 4)). Let me check that:Multiply (x^2 + 9) by (x^2 - 3x - 4):First, (x^2 * x^2 = x^4).Then, (x^2 * (-3x) = -3x^3).Then, (x^2 * (-4) = -4x^2).Then, (9 * x^2 = 9x^2).(9 * (-3x) = -27x).(9 * (-4) = -36).Combine like terms:(x^4 - 3x^3 + (-4x^2 + 9x^2) + (-27x) + (-36)).Simplify:(x^4 - 3x^3 + 5x^2 - 27x - 36). Perfect, that's the original equation.So, the pure imaginary solutions come from (x^2 + 9 = 0), which gives (x = pm 3i).Therefore, the two pure imaginary solutions are (3i) and (-3i).Wait, let me just double-check. If I plug (x = 3i) into the original equation:((3i)^4 - 3(3i)^3 + 5(3i)^2 - 27(3i) - 36).Calculate each term:((3i)^4 = (81)(i^4) = 81(1) = 81).(-3(3i)^3 = -3*(27i^3) = -3*(27*(-i)) = -3*(-27i) = 81i).(5(3i)^2 = 5*(9i^2) = 5*(-9) = -45).(-27(3i) = -81i).(-36) remains.So, adding all together:81 + 81i - 45 - 81i - 36.Simplify:(81 - 45 - 36) + (81i - 81i) = (0) + (0i) = 0. Perfect.Similarly, for (x = -3i):((-3i)^4 - 3(-3i)^3 + 5(-3i)^2 - 27(-3i) - 36).Calculate each term:((-3i)^4 = (81)(i^4) = 81(1) = 81).(-3(-3i)^3 = -3*(-27i^3) = -3*(-27*(-i)) = -3*(27i) = -81i).(5(-3i)^2 = 5*(9i^2) = 5*(-9) = -45).(-27(-3i) = 81i).(-36) remains.Adding all together:81 - 81i - 45 + 81i - 36.Simplify:(81 - 45 - 36) + (-81i + 81i) = (0) + (0i) = 0. Perfect.So, both (3i) and (-3i) are indeed solutions.Therefore, the two pure imaginary solutions are (3i) and (-3i).**Final Answer**The pure imaginary solutions are boxed{3i} and boxed{-3i}."},{"question":"Given vectors overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{b}, if the projection of overrightarrow{a} in the direction of overrightarrow{b} is 3 and |overrightarrow{b}|=2, then overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{b}= ______.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here about vectors. It says that given vectors a and b, the projection of a in the direction of b is 3, and the magnitude of b is 2. I need to find the dot product of a and b. Hmm, projections and dot products... I think I remember some formulas from my classes, but let me try to recall them step by step.First, what is a projection? If I remember correctly, the projection of vector a onto vector b is like the shadow of a on the line defined by b. It's the component of a that's in the direction of b. The formula for the projection, I think, is something like (a ¬∑ b) divided by the magnitude of b. Wait, no, that might just be the scalar projection. Let me think.Yes, actually, there are two types of projections: scalar and vector. The scalar projection is the magnitude of the projection, which is a scalar value, and the vector projection is the actual vector component of a in the direction of b. Since the problem mentions the projection of a in the direction of b is 3, I believe that refers to the scalar projection because it's giving a numerical value without specifying a direction. So, scalar projection is 3.The formula for the scalar projection of a onto b is (a ¬∑ b) divided by the magnitude of b. So, scalar projection = (a ¬∑ b) / |b|. Let me write that down:Scalar projection = (a ¬∑ b) / |b|Given that the scalar projection is 3 and |b| is 2, I can plug those values into the formula:3 = (a ¬∑ b) / 2So, to find a ¬∑ b, I can rearrange this equation:a ¬∑ b = 3 * 2 = 6Wait, that seems straightforward. So, is the answer just 6? Let me double-check to make sure I didn't mix up any formulas.Another way to think about the projection is using the angle between the vectors. The scalar projection can also be expressed as |a| cosŒ∏, where Œ∏ is the angle between a and b. But that's equal to (a ¬∑ b) / |b|, right? Because the dot product formula is a ¬∑ b = |a||b|cosŒ∏. So, if I divide both sides by |b|, I get (a ¬∑ b)/|b| = |a|cosŒ∏, which is the scalar projection. So, that confirms that the scalar projection is indeed (a ¬∑ b)/|b|.So, substituting the given values:Scalar projection = 3 = (a ¬∑ b) / 2Therefore, a ¬∑ b = 6.Hmm, that seems consistent. I don't think I made any mistakes here. Let me just visualize it to make sure.Imagine vector b is pointing in some direction, and vector a has a component in the direction of b. The projection of a onto b is like stretching a onto b and measuring how much of a is in that direction. Since the projection is 3, and the length of b is 2, the dot product, which is related to the product of their magnitudes and the cosine of the angle between them, should be 6. That makes sense because if the projection is 3, which is half of 6, and since |b| is 2, it all lines up.Wait, actually, projection is (a ¬∑ b)/|b|, so if that's 3, then a ¬∑ b is 3 times |b|, which is 3*2=6. Yep, that seems right.I don't think there's any other way to interpret the problem. It's pretty straightforward once you remember the formula for the scalar projection. So, I think I can confidently say that the dot product of a and b is 6.**Final Answer**The dot product of vectors overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{b} is boxed{6}."},{"question":"Given ( a = log_{4} e ), ( b = log_{3} 4 ), and ( c = log_{4} 5 ), determine the relationship between the magnitudes of ( a ), ( b ), and ( c ).","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I'm given three logarithms: ( a = log_{4} e ), ( b = log_{3} 4 ), and ( c = log_{4} 5 ). I need to figure out the relationship between their magnitudes, meaning I have to determine which one is bigger, which one is smaller, and so on. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that logarithms can be converted from one base to another using the change of base formula. Maybe that can help me compare them more easily. The change of base formula is ( log_{b} a = frac{ln a}{ln b} ), right? So, if I convert all of them to natural logarithms, I can perhaps compare the values more straightforwardly.Let me write down each of them using the change of base formula:1. ( a = log_{4} e = frac{ln e}{ln 4} )2. ( b = log_{3} 4 = frac{ln 4}{ln 3} )3. ( c = log_{4} 5 = frac{ln 5}{ln 4} )Okay, so now all of them are expressed in terms of natural logarithms. Let me compute each one step by step.Starting with ( a ):( a = frac{ln e}{ln 4} ). I know that ( ln e = 1 ), so this simplifies to ( a = frac{1}{ln 4} ). Hmm, ( ln 4 ) is approximately ( 1.386 ), so ( a ) is roughly ( 1 / 1.386 approx 0.721 ). So, ( a ) is approximately 0.721.Next, ( b = frac{ln 4}{ln 3} ). Let me compute the values of ( ln 4 ) and ( ln 3 ). I remember that ( ln 3 ) is approximately 1.0986 and ( ln 4 ) is approximately 1.3863. So, ( b ) is ( 1.3863 / 1.0986 approx 1.2618 ). So, ( b ) is approximately 1.2618.Now, ( c = frac{ln 5}{ln 4} ). Again, I can use approximate values. ( ln 5 ) is approximately 1.6094, and ( ln 4 ) is approximately 1.3863. So, ( c ) is ( 1.6094 / 1.3863 approx 1.161 ). So, ( c ) is approximately 1.161.Wait, let me double-check these calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.For ( a ): ( ln e = 1 ), so ( 1 / ln 4 ). Since ( ln 4 ) is about 1.386, yes, 1 divided by that is approximately 0.721. That seems right.For ( b ): ( ln 4 approx 1.3863 ), ( ln 3 approx 1.0986 ). So, 1.3863 divided by 1.0986. Let me do that division more accurately. 1.3863 √∑ 1.0986. Let's see, 1.0986 times 1.26 is approximately 1.386. So, yes, 1.2618 is correct.For ( c ): ( ln 5 approx 1.6094 ), ( ln 4 approx 1.3863 ). So, 1.6094 √∑ 1.3863. Let me compute that. 1.3863 times 1.16 is approximately 1.609. So, yes, 1.161 is correct.So, summarizing the approximate values:- ( a approx 0.721 )- ( b approx 1.2618 )- ( c approx 1.161 )So, comparing these, ( a ) is the smallest, followed by ( c ), and then ( b ) is the largest. So, the order from smallest to largest is ( a < c < b ).But wait, let me think again. Is there another way to compare them without calculating the approximate values? Maybe using properties of logarithms or exponents?Let me consider the functions involved. Since all the logarithms are with bases greater than 1, they are increasing functions. So, if I can figure out the relationship between the arguments and the bases, I can compare the logarithms.Starting with ( a = log_{4} e ). Since ( e ) is approximately 2.718, and 4 is greater than e, so ( log_{4} e ) is less than 1 because 4^1 = 4, which is greater than e. So, ( a < 1 ).For ( b = log_{3} 4 ). Since 3^1 = 3 and 3^2 = 9, and 4 is between 3 and 9, so ( log_{3} 4 ) is between 1 and 2. But more precisely, since 4 is closer to 3 than to 9, it's less than 1.5. Wait, but earlier calculation showed it's approximately 1.26, which is between 1 and 1.5. So, ( b > 1 ).For ( c = log_{4} 5 ). Similarly, 4^1 = 4 and 4^2 = 16, so 5 is between 4 and 16, so ( log_{4} 5 ) is between 1 and 2. Since 5 is closer to 4 than to 16, it's less than 1.5. But from the approximate value, it's about 1.16, so ( c > 1 ) but less than ( b ).So, putting it all together, ( a < 1 ), ( c > 1 ), ( b > 1 ). So, ( a ) is less than both ( c ) and ( b ). Now, between ( c ) and ( b ), which is larger?We can compare ( b = log_{3} 4 ) and ( c = log_{4} 5 ). Let me see if I can find a relationship without calculating their approximate values.Alternatively, I can use the change of base formula to express both in terms of the same base, say base 2 or base 10, but maybe base 2 is easier since 4 is a power of 2.Wait, ( 4 = 2^2 ), so maybe expressing everything in base 2 could help.Let me try that.First, ( a = log_{4} e = frac{log_{2} e}{log_{2} 4} = frac{log_{2} e}{2} ). Since ( log_{2} e ) is approximately 1.4427, so ( a approx 1.4427 / 2 approx 0.7213 ), which matches my earlier calculation.For ( b = log_{3} 4 ). Hmm, 3 is not a power of 2, so maybe converting to base 2 isn't as straightforward. Alternatively, express both ( b ) and ( c ) in terms of base 4.Wait, ( b = log_{3} 4 ). Let me write that as ( frac{log_{4} 4}{log_{4} 3} ) using change of base. Since ( log_{4} 4 = 1 ), so ( b = frac{1}{log_{4} 3} ). Similarly, ( c = log_{4} 5 ).So, ( b = frac{1}{log_{4} 3} ) and ( c = log_{4} 5 ). So, if I can compare ( log_{4} 3 ) and ( log_{4} 5 ), I can find the relationship between ( b ) and ( c ).Since 3 < 5, and since logarithm base 4 is an increasing function, ( log_{4} 3 < log_{4} 5 ). Therefore, ( log_{4} 3 < c ). So, ( log_{4} 3 < c ), which implies that ( frac{1}{log_{4} 3} > frac{1}{c} ). But ( b = frac{1}{log_{4} 3} ), so ( b > frac{1}{c} ).Wait, but I need to compare ( b ) and ( c ), not ( b ) and ( 1/c ). Maybe this approach isn't directly helpful.Alternatively, let me consider the function ( f(x) = log_{x} y ) where y is fixed. How does this function behave as x changes?Wait, if I fix y and vary x, ( f(x) = log_{x} y = frac{ln y}{ln x} ). So, as x increases, ( ln x ) increases, so ( f(x) ) decreases. So, if I have two different bases, say 3 and 4, and I'm taking the logarithm of 4 in base 3 and 5 in base 4.Wait, maybe it's better to think about the reciprocal relationship. Since ( b = log_{3} 4 ) and ( c = log_{4} 5 ), perhaps I can relate them through exponents.Alternatively, let me compute ( b times c ). ( b times c = log_{3} 4 times log_{4} 5 ). Using the change of base formula, this is ( frac{ln 4}{ln 3} times frac{ln 5}{ln 4} = frac{ln 5}{ln 3} = log_{3} 5 ). So, ( b times c = log_{3} 5 ).Hmm, interesting. So, ( b times c = log_{3} 5 ). Since 5 > 3, ( log_{3} 5 > 1 ). So, ( b times c > 1 ). But does that help me compare ( b ) and ( c )?Alternatively, maybe I can compare ( b ) and ( c ) by considering their exponents.Let me think about exponents. If I can find exponents such that ( 3^b = 4 ) and ( 4^c = 5 ). So, ( 3^b = 4 ) and ( 4^c = 5 ). If I substitute the first equation into the second, I get ( (3^b)^c = 5 ), which is ( 3^{b c} = 5 ). So, ( b c = log_{3} 5 ), which is consistent with what I found earlier.But I still need a way to compare ( b ) and ( c ). Maybe I can use inequalities.Let me see. Since ( 4^c = 5 ), taking natural logs, ( c ln 4 = ln 5 ), so ( c = frac{ln 5}{ln 4} approx 1.16 ).Similarly, ( 3^b = 4 ), so ( b = frac{ln 4}{ln 3} approx 1.26 ).So, from these, ( b > c ). So, ( a < c < b ).Alternatively, without using approximate values, can I prove that ( log_{3} 4 > log_{4} 5 )?Let me consider the function ( f(x) = log_{x} (x + 1) ). For x > 1, is this function increasing or decreasing?Wait, let me compute the derivative to see. But maybe that's too complicated.Alternatively, let me cross-multiply the inequalities.Suppose I want to compare ( log_{3} 4 ) and ( log_{4} 5 ). Let me express both in terms of natural logs:( log_{3} 4 = frac{ln 4}{ln 3} ) and ( log_{4} 5 = frac{ln 5}{ln 4} ).So, to compare ( frac{ln 4}{ln 3} ) and ( frac{ln 5}{ln 4} ), let's cross-multiply:Is ( (ln 4)^2 > (ln 3)(ln 5) )?If yes, then ( frac{ln 4}{ln 3} > frac{ln 5}{ln 4} ), meaning ( b > c ).So, let's compute ( (ln 4)^2 ) and ( (ln 3)(ln 5) ).We know:- ( ln 3 approx 1.0986 )- ( ln 4 approx 1.3863 )- ( ln 5 approx 1.6094 )So, ( (ln 4)^2 approx (1.3863)^2 approx 1.921 )And ( (ln 3)(ln 5) approx 1.0986 times 1.6094 approx 1.769 )So, ( 1.921 > 1.769 ), which means ( (ln 4)^2 > (ln 3)(ln 5) ), so ( frac{ln 4}{ln 3} > frac{ln 5}{ln 4} ), hence ( b > c ).Therefore, without using approximate decimal values, I can conclude that ( b > c ).So, putting it all together:- ( a approx 0.721 )- ( c approx 1.161 )- ( b approx 1.2618 )Thus, the order is ( a < c < b ).Wait, but just to make sure, let me think if there's another way to see this. Maybe by comparing the exponents.For ( a = log_{4} e ), since ( e approx 2.718 ) and 4 is 2^2, so ( log_{4} e = frac{log_{2} e}{2} approx frac{1.4427}{2} approx 0.7213 ). So, that's correct.For ( c = log_{4} 5 ), since 5 is greater than 4, it's more than 1, but less than 2. Similarly, ( b = log_{3} 4 ), since 4 is greater than 3, it's more than 1, but less than 2. So, both ( b ) and ( c ) are greater than 1, but which is bigger?We already saw that ( b > c ) because ( (ln 4)^2 > (ln 3)(ln 5) ). So, that's solid.Therefore, the relationship is ( a < c < b ).I think that's the conclusion. So, ( a ) is the smallest, followed by ( c ), and then ( b ) is the largest.**Final Answer**The relationship between the magnitudes is ( a < c < b ), so the final answer is boxed{a < c < b}."},{"question":"Alex rides his bike 9km to work every day from Monday to Friday.

Some value of ( z ) is ( frac{5}{3} ) times the difference of the corresponding values ( x ) and ( y ). Find the numerical value of the coefficient ( k ).","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here, and I need to find the value of the coefficient ( k ). Let me try to parse the problem step by step.First, it says that the difference between the variables ( z ) and ( y ) is proportional to the variable ( x ). So, mathematically, I can write that as:( z - y = kx )where ( k ) is the proportionality coefficient.Then, it also says that the difference between ( x ) and ( z ) is proportional to the variable ( y ), with the same proportionality coefficient ( k ). So, that would be:( x - z = ky )Alright, so now I have two equations:1. ( z - y = kx )  -- Equation (1)2. ( x - z = ky )  -- Equation (2)Additionally, the problem states that some value of ( z ) is ( frac{5}{3} ) times the difference of the corresponding values ( x ) and ( y ). So, that translates to:( z = frac{5}{3}(x - y) )  -- Equation (3)Okay, so now I have three equations. Let me write them down again:1. ( z - y = kx )2. ( x - z = ky )3. ( z = frac{5}{3}(x - y) )I need to solve for ( k ). Let me see how I can manipulate these equations.First, perhaps I can express ( z ) from Equation (1) or Equation (2) and substitute into Equation (3). Let me try that.From Equation (1):( z = kx + y )  -- Equation (1a)From Equation (2):( x - z = ky ) => ( z = x - ky )  -- Equation (2a)So, from Equation (1a) and Equation (2a), both expressions equal to ( z ). Therefore, I can set them equal to each other:( kx + y = x - ky )Let me rearrange this equation:( kx + y = x - ky )Bring all terms to one side:( kx + y - x + ky = 0 )Factor terms:( (k - 1)x + (1 + k)y = 0 )  -- Equation (4)Hmm, okay. So, this is one equation relating ( x ) and ( y ). Now, let's see Equation (3):( z = frac{5}{3}(x - y) )But from Equation (1a), ( z = kx + y ). So, substituting into Equation (3):( kx + y = frac{5}{3}(x - y) )Let me write that out:( kx + y = frac{5}{3}x - frac{5}{3}y )Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate denominators:( 3kx + 3y = 5x - 5y )Bring all terms to one side:( 3kx + 3y - 5x + 5y = 0 )Combine like terms:( (3k - 5)x + (3 + 5)y = 0 )Simplify:( (3k - 5)x + 8y = 0 )  -- Equation (5)Now, I have Equation (4):( (k - 1)x + (1 + k)y = 0 )And Equation (5):( (3k - 5)x + 8y = 0 )So, now I have two equations (Equation 4 and Equation 5) in terms of ( x ) and ( y ). Since these are homogeneous equations, the only solution is the trivial solution unless the determinant is zero. But since we are dealing with variables, perhaps we can set up a system where the coefficients are proportional.Alternatively, I can express ( y ) in terms of ( x ) from Equation (4) and substitute into Equation (5).From Equation (4):( (k - 1)x + (1 + k)y = 0 )Let's solve for ( y ):( (1 + k)y = -(k - 1)x )So,( y = frac{-(k - 1)}{1 + k}x )Simplify numerator:( y = frac{-(k - 1)}{k + 1}x = frac{(1 - k)}{k + 1}x )So, ( y = frac{1 - k}{1 + k}x )  -- Equation (6)Now, substitute Equation (6) into Equation (5):( (3k - 5)x + 8y = 0 )Replace ( y ):( (3k - 5)x + 8left( frac{1 - k}{1 + k}x right) = 0 )Factor out ( x ):( [ (3k - 5) + 8 cdot frac{1 - k}{1 + k} ]x = 0 )Since ( x ) is a variable and not necessarily zero, the coefficient must be zero:( (3k - 5) + 8 cdot frac{1 - k}{1 + k} = 0 )Let me write this as:( 3k - 5 + frac{8(1 - k)}{1 + k} = 0 )To solve for ( k ), let me combine these terms. Let's get a common denominator for the terms. The denominator is ( 1 + k ).So, rewrite ( 3k - 5 ) as ( frac{(3k - 5)(1 + k)}{1 + k} ):( frac{(3k - 5)(1 + k)}{1 + k} + frac{8(1 - k)}{1 + k} = 0 )Combine the numerators:( frac{(3k - 5)(1 + k) + 8(1 - k)}{1 + k} = 0 )Since the denominator ( 1 + k ) is not zero (because ( k ) is a positive integer, so ( k geq 1 )), the numerator must be zero:( (3k - 5)(1 + k) + 8(1 - k) = 0 )Let me expand ( (3k - 5)(1 + k) ):First, multiply 3k by (1 + k): ( 3k cdot 1 + 3k cdot k = 3k + 3k^2 )Then, multiply -5 by (1 + k): ( -5 cdot 1 + (-5) cdot k = -5 - 5k )So, altogether:( 3k + 3k^2 - 5 - 5k )Combine like terms:( 3k^2 + (3k - 5k) - 5 = 3k^2 - 2k - 5 )Now, the other term is ( 8(1 - k) = 8 - 8k )So, putting it all together:( 3k^2 - 2k - 5 + 8 - 8k = 0 )Combine like terms:( 3k^2 + (-2k - 8k) + (-5 + 8) = 0 )Simplify:( 3k^2 - 10k + 3 = 0 )So, now I have a quadratic equation:( 3k^2 - 10k + 3 = 0 )Let me solve this quadratic equation for ( k ). The quadratic formula is:( k = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} )Where ( a = 3 ), ( b = -10 ), ( c = 3 ).Compute discriminant:( D = (-10)^2 - 4 cdot 3 cdot 3 = 100 - 36 = 64 )So, square root of discriminant is 8.Thus,( k = frac{-(-10) pm 8}{2 cdot 3} = frac{10 pm 8}{6} )So, two solutions:1. ( k = frac{10 + 8}{6} = frac{18}{6} = 3 )2. ( k = frac{10 - 8}{6} = frac{2}{6} = frac{1}{3} )But the problem states that ( k ) is a positive integer. So, ( frac{1}{3} ) is not an integer, so we discard that.Therefore, ( k = 3 ).Wait, let me just verify this solution to make sure I didn't make a mistake.So, if ( k = 3 ), let's check the equations.From Equation (1): ( z - y = 3x ) => ( z = 3x + y )From Equation (2): ( x - z = 3y ) => ( z = x - 3y )Set equal:( 3x + y = x - 3y )Bring terms to one side:( 3x + y - x + 3y = 0 ) => ( 2x + 4y = 0 ) => ( x = -2y )Hmm, so ( x = -2y ). Let's plug this into Equation (3):( z = frac{5}{3}(x - y) )But ( x = -2y ), so:( z = frac{5}{3}(-2y - y) = frac{5}{3}(-3y) = -5y )So, ( z = -5y )Now, from Equation (1): ( z = 3x + y )Substitute ( x = -2y ):( z = 3(-2y) + y = -6y + y = -5y )Which matches. Similarly, from Equation (2): ( z = x - 3y )Substitute ( x = -2y ):( z = -2y - 3y = -5y )Which also matches. So, all equations are consistent.Therefore, ( k = 3 ) is indeed the correct solution.**Final Answer**The numerical value of the coefficient ( k ) is boxed{3}."},{"question":"Among 7 integers from 2 to 8, randomly select 3 different numbers. The number of different ways to select 3 numbers whose product is a multiple of 3 is ______.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of different ways to select 3 numbers from 7 integers (which are from 2 to 8) such that their product is a multiple of 3. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, let me list out the numbers we're dealing with. The integers from 2 to 8 are: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. So that's seven numbers in total. Now, we need to choose 3 different numbers from these 7. The question is about how many such combinations will result in a product that's a multiple of 3.I remember that a product is a multiple of 3 if at least one of the numbers in the product is a multiple of 3. So, in other words, if at least one of the three numbers we pick is divisible by 3, then their product will be a multiple of 3. That makes sense because 3 is a prime number, so it can't be formed by multiplying other numbers unless one of them is already a multiple of 3.So, maybe it's easier to calculate the total number of ways to choose 3 numbers and then subtract the number of ways where none of the numbers are multiples of 3. That should give me the number of combinations where at least one number is a multiple of 3, which is what we need.Let me write that down:Total number of ways to choose 3 numbers from 7: C(7,3)Number of ways where none of the numbers are multiples of 3: C(n,3), where n is the number of non-multiples of 3 in the list.So, first, let's find how many numbers in the list are multiples of 3. Looking at the numbers: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.Multiples of 3 are 3 and 6. So, there are 2 multiples of 3. That means the number of non-multiples is 7 - 2 = 5.So, the number of ways to choose 3 numbers with none being multiples of 3 is C(5,3).Therefore, the number of desired combinations is C(7,3) - C(5,3).Let me compute these values.First, C(7,3). The formula for combinations is C(n,k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!).So, C(7,3) = 7! / (3! * (7 - 3)!) = (7 * 6 * 5) / (3 * 2 * 1) = 35.Wait, let me compute that again to make sure. 7 choose 3 is 35. Yeah, that's correct.Now, C(5,3). Using the same formula:C(5,3) = 5! / (3! * (5 - 3)!) = (5 * 4 * 3) / (3 * 2 * 1) = 10.So, 10 ways to choose 3 numbers that are all non-multiples of 3.Therefore, the number of ways where the product is a multiple of 3 is 35 - 10 = 25.Wait, is that right? Let me double-check.Total combinations: 35. Non-multiples: 5 numbers. So, choosing 3 from 5 is 10. So, 35 - 10 = 25. That seems correct.But just to be thorough, maybe I can think about it another way. Instead of subtracting, maybe I can calculate the number of combinations that include at least one multiple of 3 directly.So, how many ways are there to include exactly one multiple of 3, exactly two multiples of 3, or exactly three multiples of 3.But in our case, since there are only two multiples of 3 (3 and 6), we can't have three multiples of 3. So, the cases are:1. Exactly one multiple of 3 and two non-multiples.2. Exactly two multiples of 3 and one non-multiple.Let me compute these separately and add them up.First, exactly one multiple of 3: There are 2 choices for the multiple of 3 (either 3 or 6), and then we need to choose 2 numbers from the 5 non-multiples.So, number of ways = C(2,1) * C(5,2).C(2,1) is 2, and C(5,2) is 10. So, 2 * 10 = 20.Second, exactly two multiples of 3: There's only one way to choose both multiples of 3, since there are only two. Then, we need to choose 1 number from the 5 non-multiples.So, number of ways = C(2,2) * C(5,1).C(2,2) is 1, and C(5,1) is 5. So, 1 * 5 = 5.Adding these together: 20 + 5 = 25. So, same result as before. That's reassuring.Therefore, the number of different ways is 25.Wait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in my calculations, let me recalculate C(5,2) and C(5,1).C(5,2) is 10, which is correct because 5*4 / 2 = 10.C(5,1) is 5, which is straightforward.So, 2*10=20 and 1*5=5, so 20+5=25. Yep, that seems right.Alternatively, another way to think about it is to list all possible combinations, but that might take too long since there are 35 total. But maybe I can list the non-multiples and see how many combinations they have.The non-multiples of 3 are: 2, 4, 5, 7, 8. So, 5 numbers. The number of ways to choose 3 from these is 10, as we calculated earlier. So, subtracting that from the total 35 gives 25, which is the number of combinations that include at least one multiple of 3.So, all methods lead to the same answer, which is 25.Therefore, I think the answer is 25.**Final Answer**The number of different ways is boxed{25}."},{"question":"Given the parabola x^{2}=8y, the chord AB has its midpoint's ordinate equal to 4. The maximum value of |AB| is _____.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a parabola, specifically ( x^2 = 8y ). The question is about finding the maximum length of a chord AB where the midpoint of AB has its ordinate (which is the y-coordinate) equal to 4. Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down step by step.First, I remember that the general equation of a parabola can be written in different forms. In this case, ( x^2 = 8y ) is a standard form of a parabola that opens upwards. The standard form is usually ( x^2 = 4py ), where p is the focal length. Comparing that to our equation, ( 4p = 8 ), so ( p = 2 ). That means the focus is at (0, 2), but I don't know if that's directly relevant here.Now, the problem is about a chord AB of this parabola. A chord is a line segment joining two points on the parabola. The midpoint of this chord has its y-coordinate (ordinate) equal to 4. So, the midpoint M of AB is (h, 4) for some h. Our goal is to find the maximum possible length of AB.I think I need to express the coordinates of points A and B in terms of some variables, then use the midpoint condition to relate them, and then find the distance between A and B. After that, I can find the maximum value of this distance.Let me denote points A and B on the parabola. Since the parabola is ( x^2 = 8y ), any point on the parabola can be written as (x, ( x^2/8 )). So let me let point A be (a, ( a^2/8 )) and point B be (b, ( b^2/8 )).The midpoint M of AB would then have coordinates:( M_x = frac{a + b}{2} )( M_y = frac{(a^2/8) + (b^2/8)}{2} = frac{a^2 + b^2}{16} )But we know that the ordinate (y-coordinate) of M is 4, so:( frac{a^2 + b^2}{16} = 4 )Multiplying both sides by 16:( a^2 + b^2 = 64 )Okay, so that's one equation relating a and b.Now, the length of chord AB can be found using the distance formula:( |AB| = sqrt{(a - b)^2 + left( frac{a^2}{8} - frac{b^2}{8} right)^2} )Simplify this expression:First, factor out the 1/8 in the y-component:( |AB| = sqrt{(a - b)^2 + left( frac{a^2 - b^2}{8} right)^2} )Notice that ( a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b) ), so let's substitute that:( |AB| = sqrt{(a - b)^2 + left( frac{(a - b)(a + b)}{8} right)^2} )Factor out ( (a - b)^2 ) from both terms inside the square root:( |AB| = sqrt{(a - b)^2 left[1 + left( frac{a + b}{8} right)^2 right]} )Take ( |a - b| ) out of the square root:( |AB| = |a - b| sqrt{1 + left( frac{a + b}{8} right)^2} )Since distance is always positive, we can drop the absolute value:( |AB| = |a - b| sqrt{1 + left( frac{a + b}{8} right)^2} )Okay, so now we have |AB| expressed in terms of a and b. But we also have the equation from the midpoint condition: ( a^2 + b^2 = 64 ).I think it might be helpful to express this in terms of variables that can be related more easily. Let me consider using substitution or some other method. Maybe we can let u = a + b and v = a - b. That way, we can express a and b in terms of u and v.Let me try that substitution:Let ( u = a + b ) and ( v = a - b ). Then, we can solve for a and b:( a = frac{u + v}{2} )( b = frac{u - v}{2} )Now, let's compute ( a^2 + b^2 ):( a^2 + b^2 = left( frac{u + v}{2} right)^2 + left( frac{u - v}{2} right)^2 )Expanding both squares:( = frac{(u + v)^2}{4} + frac{(u - v)^2}{4} )( = frac{u^2 + 2uv + v^2}{4} + frac{u^2 - 2uv + v^2}{4} )Combine the terms:( = frac{2u^2 + 2v^2}{4} )Simplify:( = frac{u^2 + v^2}{2} )But we know that ( a^2 + b^2 = 64 ), so:( frac{u^2 + v^2}{2} = 64 )Multiply both sides by 2:( u^2 + v^2 = 128 )Okay, so now we have another equation: ( u^2 + v^2 = 128 ).Going back to our expression for |AB|, which was:( |AB| = |v| sqrt{1 + left( frac{u}{8} right)^2} )Since |v| is just the absolute value of v, and since we're looking for the maximum value, we can consider v as positive without loss of generality because the square will take care of the sign.So, let's write:( |AB| = v sqrt{1 + left( frac{u}{8} right)^2} )Now, our goal is to maximize |AB|, given that ( u^2 + v^2 = 128 ).This seems like an optimization problem with a constraint. So, I can use the method of Lagrange multipliers or express one variable in terms of the other and substitute.Let me try substitution. From the constraint ( u^2 + v^2 = 128 ), we can express ( v^2 = 128 - u^2 ), so ( v = sqrt{128 - u^2} ). Since we're dealing with real numbers, u must satisfy ( |u| leq sqrt{128} = 8sqrt{2} ).So, substituting v into |AB|:( |AB| = sqrt{128 - u^2} cdot sqrt{1 + left( frac{u}{8} right)^2} )Let me simplify this expression:First, square both terms inside the square roots:( |AB|^2 = (128 - u^2) left(1 + frac{u^2}{64}right) )Multiply this out:( |AB|^2 = (128 - u^2) left(1 + frac{u^2}{64}right) )Let me compute this:First, expand the terms:( = 128 cdot 1 + 128 cdot frac{u^2}{64} - u^2 cdot 1 - u^2 cdot frac{u^2}{64} )Simplify each term:( = 128 + 2u^2 - u^2 - frac{u^4}{64} )Combine like terms:( = 128 + u^2 - frac{u^4}{64} )So, ( |AB|^2 = 128 + u^2 - frac{u^4}{64} )Now, to find the maximum of |AB|, we can find the maximum of |AB|^2, since the square root function is monotonically increasing.Let me denote ( f(u) = 128 + u^2 - frac{u^4}{64} ). We need to find the maximum of f(u) for ( u ) in the interval ( [-8sqrt{2}, 8sqrt{2}] ).To find the maximum, we can take the derivative of f(u) with respect to u, set it equal to zero, and solve for u.Compute f'(u):( f'(u) = 2u - frac{4u^3}{64} )Simplify:( f'(u) = 2u - frac{u^3}{16} )Set f'(u) = 0:( 2u - frac{u^3}{16} = 0 )Factor out u:( u left(2 - frac{u^2}{16}right) = 0 )So, the critical points are at u = 0 and ( 2 - frac{u^2}{16} = 0 ).Solving ( 2 - frac{u^2}{16} = 0 ):( frac{u^2}{16} = 2 )( u^2 = 32 )( u = pm sqrt{32} = pm 4sqrt{2} )So, the critical points are at u = 0, u = 4‚àö2, and u = -4‚àö2.Now, we need to evaluate f(u) at these critical points and also check the endpoints of the interval, which are u = ¬±8‚àö2.Compute f(0):( f(0) = 128 + 0 - 0 = 128 )Compute f(4‚àö2):First, compute u^2 = (4‚àö2)^2 = 16 * 2 = 32Compute u^4 = (4‚àö2)^4 = (16 * 2)^2 = 32^2 = 1024So,( f(4sqrt{2}) = 128 + 32 - frac{1024}{64} )Simplify:( = 160 - 16 = 144 )Similarly, f(-4‚àö2) will be the same as f(4‚àö2) because all terms are even powers:( f(-4sqrt{2}) = 144 )Now, compute f(8‚àö2):u = 8‚àö2, so u^2 = (8‚àö2)^2 = 64 * 2 = 128u^4 = (8‚àö2)^4 = (64 * 2)^2 = 128^2 = 16384So,( f(8sqrt{2}) = 128 + 128 - frac{16384}{64} )Simplify:( = 256 - 256 = 0 )Similarly, f(-8‚àö2) will be 0 as well.So, summarizing:- At u = 0, f(u) = 128- At u = ¬±4‚àö2, f(u) = 144- At u = ¬±8‚àö2, f(u) = 0Therefore, the maximum value of f(u) is 144, achieved at u = ¬±4‚àö2.Therefore, the maximum value of |AB|^2 is 144, so the maximum |AB| is ‚àö144 = 12.Wait, hold on. Let me verify that. If |AB|^2 is 144, then |AB| is 12. That seems straightforward.But let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when dealing with multiple substitutions, it's easy to make a mistake.So, starting from |AB|^2 = 128 + u^2 - (u^4)/64. When u = 4‚àö2, u^2 = 32, u^4 = 1024. So, 128 + 32 - 1024/64 = 160 - 16 = 144. That's correct.Similarly, when u = 0, it's 128, which is less than 144, and when u = 8‚àö2, it's 0, which is the minimum. So yes, 144 is the maximum.Therefore, the maximum length of chord AB is 12.But just to make sure, let me think about another approach. Maybe using parametric equations or calculus.Alternatively, I could parametrize the points on the parabola. Since the parabola is ( x^2 = 8y ), we can write parametric equations as ( x = 4t ), ( y = 2t^2 ), because substituting into the parabola equation: ( (4t)^2 = 16t^2 = 8y ) implies y = 2t^2.So, point A can be (4t1, 2t1^2) and point B can be (4t2, 2t2^2). Then, the midpoint M would be:( M_x = frac{4t1 + 4t2}{2} = 2(t1 + t2) )( M_y = frac{2t1^2 + 2t2^2}{2} = t1^2 + t2^2 )Given that M_y = 4, so:( t1^2 + t2^2 = 4 )Now, the length of AB is:( |AB| = sqrt{(4t1 - 4t2)^2 + (2t1^2 - 2t2^2)^2} )Factor out the constants:( = sqrt{16(t1 - t2)^2 + 4(t1^2 - t2^2)^2} )Factor further:( = sqrt{16(t1 - t2)^2 + 4(t1 - t2)^2(t1 + t2)^2} )Factor out 4(t1 - t2)^2:( = sqrt{4(t1 - t2)^2 [4 + (t1 + t2)^2]} )Take out the 2|t1 - t2|:( = 2|t1 - t2| sqrt{4 + (t1 + t2)^2} )So, |AB| = 2|t1 - t2|‚àö[4 + (t1 + t2)^2]Now, we have the condition t1^2 + t2^2 = 4.Let me denote s = t1 + t2 and d = t1 - t2. Then, t1 = (s + d)/2 and t2 = (s - d)/2.Compute t1^2 + t2^2:( t1^2 + t2^2 = left( frac{s + d}{2} right)^2 + left( frac{s - d}{2} right)^2 )Expand:( = frac{(s + d)^2 + (s - d)^2}{4} )( = frac{s^2 + 2sd + d^2 + s^2 - 2sd + d^2}{4} )Simplify:( = frac{2s^2 + 2d^2}{4} = frac{s^2 + d^2}{2} )Given that t1^2 + t2^2 = 4, so:( frac{s^2 + d^2}{2} = 4 )Multiply both sides by 2:( s^2 + d^2 = 8 )So, now, our expression for |AB| becomes:|AB| = 2|d|‚àö[4 + s^2]But since |d| is non-negative, we can write:|AB| = 2d‚àö(4 + s^2), where d = |t1 - t2|But from the constraint, s^2 + d^2 = 8, so d^2 = 8 - s^2, so d = ‚àö(8 - s^2)Therefore, substituting back:|AB| = 2‚àö(8 - s^2) * ‚àö(4 + s^2)So, |AB| = 2‚àö[(8 - s^2)(4 + s^2)]Let me compute the expression inside the square root:(8 - s^2)(4 + s^2) = 8*4 + 8s^2 - 4s^2 - s^4 = 32 + 4s^2 - s^4So, |AB| = 2‚àö(32 + 4s^2 - s^4)Now, let me denote g(s) = 32 + 4s^2 - s^4. We need to find the maximum of g(s), since |AB| is proportional to ‚àög(s).Compute derivative of g(s):g'(s) = 8s - 4s^3Set derivative equal to zero:8s - 4s^3 = 0Factor:4s(2 - s^2) = 0So, critical points at s = 0 and s^2 = 2, so s = ¬±‚àö2Now, evaluate g(s) at critical points and endpoints.First, endpoints: since s^2 + d^2 = 8, s can range from -‚àö8 to ‚àö8, which is -2‚àö2 to 2‚àö2.Compute g(0):g(0) = 32 + 0 - 0 = 32Compute g(‚àö2):g(‚àö2) = 32 + 4*(2) - ( (‚àö2)^4 ) = 32 + 8 - 4 = 36Similarly, g(-‚àö2) = 36Compute g(2‚àö2):g(2‚àö2) = 32 + 4*(8) - ( (2‚àö2)^4 ) = 32 + 32 - (16*4) = 64 - 64 = 0Similarly, g(-2‚àö2) = 0So, the maximum of g(s) is 36, achieved at s = ¬±‚àö2.Therefore, the maximum |AB| is 2‚àö36 = 2*6 = 12.So, same result as before. So, that's a good consistency check.Therefore, the maximum length of chord AB is 12.But just to make sure, let me think about another way. Maybe using the concept of focal chords or something else.Wait, in a parabola, the length of a focal chord can be found, but I don't think this is necessarily a focal chord because the midpoint is at y=4, which is above the focus at y=2.Alternatively, maybe using the concept of the latus rectum. The latus rectum is the chord through the focus perpendicular to the axis. For this parabola, the latus rectum length is 4p = 16. But that's a different chord.Alternatively, maybe using calculus with the first method.Wait, in the first method, we had |AB| = |a - b| * sqrt(1 + ( (a + b)/8 )^2 ), and we found that the maximum occurs when u = a + b = ¬±4‚àö2, and v = a - b = sqrt(128 - u^2) = sqrt(128 - 32) = sqrt(96) = 4‚àö6.Wait, hold on, let me check that.Wait, in the first substitution, we had u = a + b and v = a - b, with u^2 + v^2 = 128.At u = 4‚àö2, v^2 = 128 - (4‚àö2)^2 = 128 - 32 = 96, so v = sqrt(96) = 4‚àö6.Therefore, |AB| = |v| * sqrt(1 + (u/8)^2 ) = 4‚àö6 * sqrt(1 + ( (4‚àö2)/8 )^2 ) = 4‚àö6 * sqrt(1 + ( (‚àö2)/2 )^2 )Compute inside the sqrt:(‚àö2 / 2)^2 = (2)/4 = 1/2So, sqrt(1 + 1/2) = sqrt(3/2) = ‚àö(3)/‚àö(2)Therefore, |AB| = 4‚àö6 * (‚àö3 / ‚àö2 ) = 4 * (‚àö6 * ‚àö3) / ‚àö2 = 4 * (‚àö18) / ‚àö2 = 4 * (3‚àö2) / ‚àö2 = 4 * 3 = 12Yes, same result. So, that's consistent.Alternatively, if I think about the parametric form, when s = ‚àö2, then d = sqrt(8 - s^2) = sqrt(8 - 2) = sqrt(6). So, |AB| = 2*sqrt(6)*sqrt(4 + (‚àö2)^2 ) = 2*sqrt(6)*sqrt(4 + 2) = 2*sqrt(6)*sqrt(6) = 2*6 = 12. Same result.Therefore, regardless of the method, the maximum length is 12.Just to visualize, the chord AB is such that its midpoint is at (h, 4). The maximum length occurs when the chord is positioned such that it's as long as possible while still having the midpoint at y=4. From the calculations, this maximum length is 12.I think that's thorough enough. I've checked it with two different substitutions and both lead to the same conclusion. So, I feel confident that the maximum length is 12.**Final Answer**The maximum value of ( |AB| ) is boxed{12}."},{"question":"The apothem of a square having its area numerically equal to its perimeter is compared with the apothem of an equilateral triangle having its area numerically equal to its perimeter.

Both shapes have their area numerically equal to their perimeter. I need to figure out how the apothem of the square compares to that of the triangle. The options are given, so I need to work through it step by step.First, let me recall what an apothem is. The apothem of a regular polygon is the distance from the center to the midpoint of one of its sides. It's also the radius of the inscribed circle. For a square and an equilateral triangle, which are both regular polygons, the apothem can be calculated using specific formulas.Starting with the square. Let me denote the side length of the square as 's'. The perimeter of the square is 4s, and the area is s¬≤. The problem states that the area is numerically equal to the perimeter, so:s¬≤ = 4sHmm, that seems straightforward. Let me solve for 's'. Subtract 4s from both sides:s¬≤ - 4s = 0Factor out an 's':s(s - 4) = 0So, s = 0 or s = 4. Since a square can't have a side length of 0, we discard that solution. Therefore, the side length of the square is 4 units.Now, I need to find the apothem of this square. For a square, the apothem (a) is equal to half the side length times the square root of 2. Wait, is that right? Let me think. The apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. In a square, that's the same as half the side length divided by tan(œÄ/4), since the apothem is related to the radius of the inscribed circle.Wait, maybe a better way is to recall that for a regular polygon with side length 's', the apothem 'a' is given by:a = (s) / (2 tan(œÄ/n))where 'n' is the number of sides. For a square, n = 4.So, plugging in:a_square = s / (2 tan(œÄ/4))tan(œÄ/4) is 1, so:a_square = s / 2Since we found s = 4, then:a_square = 4 / 2 = 2Okay, so the apothem of the square is 2 units.Now, moving on to the equilateral triangle. Let me denote the side length as 't'. The perimeter is 3t, and the area is (‚àö3/4) t¬≤. The problem states that the area is numerically equal to the perimeter, so:(‚àö3 / 4) t¬≤ = 3tLet me solve for 't'. Multiply both sides by 4 to eliminate the denominator:‚àö3 t¬≤ = 12tDivide both sides by t (assuming t ‚â† 0, which it can't be for a triangle):‚àö3 t = 12Therefore, t = 12 / ‚àö3Simplify that by rationalizing the denominator:t = (12 / ‚àö3) * (‚àö3 / ‚àö3) = (12‚àö3) / 3 = 4‚àö3So, the side length of the equilateral triangle is 4‚àö3 units.Now, I need to find the apothem of this equilateral triangle. Again, using the formula for the apothem of a regular polygon:a_triangle = t / (2 tan(œÄ/n))For an equilateral triangle, n = 3.So,a_triangle = t / (2 tan(œÄ/3))tan(œÄ/3) is ‚àö3, so:a_triangle = t / (2‚àö3)We found t = 4‚àö3, so plug that in:a_triangle = (4‚àö3) / (2‚àö3) = (4‚àö3) / (2‚àö3)Simplify this. The ‚àö3 in the numerator and denominator cancels out:a_triangle = 4 / 2 = 2Wait, that's interesting. So, the apothem of the equilateral triangle is also 2 units. That would mean both apothems are equal. So, the answer should be option A: equal to the second.But hold on, let me double-check my calculations because that seems a bit too straightforward.Starting with the square:- Area = s¬≤, Perimeter = 4s- Set equal: s¬≤ = 4s => s = 4- Apothem formula for square: a = s / 2 = 4 / 2 = 2. That seems correct.For the equilateral triangle:- Area = (‚àö3 / 4) t¬≤, Perimeter = 3t- Set equal: (‚àö3 / 4) t¬≤ = 3t => ‚àö3 t¬≤ = 12t => t = 12 / ‚àö3 = 4‚àö3- Apothem formula: a = t / (2 tan(60¬∞)) = t / (2‚àö3) = (4‚àö3) / (2‚àö3) = 2. That also seems correct.So, both apothems are 2 units. Therefore, they are equal. So, option A is correct.Wait, but let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the apothem formula for the triangle? Because sometimes, the apothem is also related to the height.In an equilateral triangle, the height (h) is given by (‚àö3 / 2) t. The apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side, which is also the radius of the inscribed circle.The radius of the inscribed circle (r) in a triangle is given by the formula:r = Area / SemiperimeterSo, for the equilateral triangle:Area = (‚àö3 / 4) t¬≤ = (‚àö3 / 4) (4‚àö3)¬≤ = (‚àö3 / 4) * 16 * 3 = (‚àö3 / 4) * 48 = 12‚àö3Semiperimeter = (3t) / 2 = (3 * 4‚àö3) / 2 = (12‚àö3) / 2 = 6‚àö3Therefore, r = Area / Semiperimeter = 12‚àö3 / 6‚àö3 = 2So, that's another way to get the apothem, which is 2. So, that confirms it.Similarly, for the square, the apothem is the radius of the inscribed circle, which is equal to half the side length because in a square, the inscribed circle touches the midpoints of the sides. So, if the side length is 4, the apothem is 2.Therefore, both apothems are indeed equal. So, the answer is A.But wait, let me check the problem statement again to make sure I didn't misread anything.\\"The apothem of a square having its area numerically equal to its perimeter is compared with the apothem of an equilateral triangle having its area numerically equal to its perimeter. The first apothem will be: ...\\"So, yes, both shapes have area equal to perimeter, which led us to compute their respective side lengths, then their apothems, both of which turned out to be 2.

Find f(frac{3}{2}) underline{hspace{2cm}}.","answer":"Okay, so I need to find the value of the function f at 3/2, which is f(3/2). The function f is defined on all real numbers and has a period of 2. That means the function repeats every 2 units. So, f(x + 2) = f(x) for any x.Now, when x is in the interval [-1, 1), the function f is defined piecewise. For x between -1 and 0, f(x) is equal to -4x¬≤ + 2, and for x between 0 and 1, f(x) is just x. So, I need to figure out what f(3/2) is.Since 3/2 is 1.5, which is outside the interval [-1, 1), I can't directly use the given piecewise definition. But because the function is periodic with period 2, I can subtract multiples of 2 from 3/2 until I get a number that lies within the interval [-1, 1). That way, I can use the piecewise definition to find the value.Let me calculate 3/2 minus 2. 3/2 is 1.5, and 2 is 2.0, so 1.5 - 2.0 is -0.5. So, f(3/2) is equal to f(-0.5). Now, -0.5 is within the interval [-1, 0), so I can use the first part of the piecewise function, which is -4x¬≤ + 2.So, substituting x = -0.5 into that expression: f(-0.5) = -4*(-0.5)¬≤ + 2. Let me compute that step by step.First, (-0.5) squared is 0.25. Then, multiplying by -4 gives -4 * 0.25 = -1. Then, adding 2 gives -1 + 2 = 1. So, f(-0.5) is 1, which means f(3/2) is also 1.Wait, let me double-check that. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. So, (-0.5) squared is indeed 0.25. Then, -4 times 0.25 is -1. Adding 2 gives 1. Yeah, that seems correct.Alternatively, I can think of it another way. Since the period is 2, adding or subtracting 2 from the input doesn't change the value of the function. So, 3/2 is 1.5, which is 0.5 more than 1. But since the period is 2, maybe I can also add 2 to 3/2 to get 3.5, but that's further away. Subtracting 2 is better because it brings it closer to the interval [-1, 1).Wait, another thought: sometimes when dealing with periodic functions, especially with even periods, sometimes shifting by half the period can also be useful, but in this case, since the period is 2, shifting by 2 is straightforward.Let me confirm that I didn't make a mistake in the interval. The function is defined on [-1, 1), so when I subtract 2 from 3/2, I get -0.5, which is indeed in [-1, 0). So, I used the correct piece of the function.Alternatively, if I had added 2 to 3/2, I would get 7/2, which is 3.5, still outside the interval. So, subtracting 2 is the right approach.So, f(3/2) = f(-0.5) = -4*(-0.5)^2 + 2 = -4*(0.25) + 2 = -1 + 2 = 1.Therefore, I think the answer is 1.**Final Answer**The value of ( fleft(frac{3}{2}right) ) is boxed{1}."},{"question":"Simplify first, then evaluate: [left(x+2yright)^{2}+left(3x+yright)left(3x-yright)-3yleft(y-xright)]div left(2x), where x=-2 and y=2.","answer":"Okay, so I need to simplify this expression first and then evaluate it with x = -2 and y = 2. The expression is [(x + 2y)^2 + (3x + y)(3x - y) - 3y(y - x)] divided by (2x). Hmm, let me take it step by step.First, I'll write down the expression again to make sure I have it right:[(x + 2y)^2 + (3x + y)(3x - y) - 3y(y - x)] √∑ (2x)Alright, so I need to simplify the numerator first before dividing by 2x. Let me break down each part of the numerator.Starting with the first term: (x + 2y)^2. I remember that (a + b)^2 is a^2 + 2ab + b^2. So applying that here:(x + 2y)^2 = x^2 + 2*x*(2y) + (2y)^2= x^2 + 4xy + 4y^2Okay, that seems straightforward. Next, the second term is (3x + y)(3x - y). That looks like a difference of squares, which is (a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2. So applying that:(3x + y)(3x - y) = (3x)^2 - (y)^2= 9x^2 - y^2Great, that simplifies nicely. Now the third term is -3y(y - x). I'll distribute the -3y across the parentheses:-3y(y - x) = -3y*y + (-3y)*(-x)= -3y^2 + 3xyWait, let me double-check that. Multiplying -3y by y gives -3y^2, and multiplying -3y by -x gives +3xy. Yep, that's correct.Now, let me put all these simplified terms back into the numerator:Numerator = (x^2 + 4xy + 4y^2) + (9x^2 - y^2) + (-3y^2 + 3xy)Hmm, now I need to combine like terms. Let's group the x^2 terms, the xy terms, and the y^2 terms.First, x^2 terms: x^2 + 9x^2 = 10x^2Next, xy terms: 4xy + 3xy = 7xyNow, y^2 terms: 4y^2 - y^2 - 3y^2. Let me compute that step by step:4y^2 - y^2 = 3y^23y^2 - 3y^2 = 0y^2Oh, interesting! The y^2 terms cancel out completely. So the numerator simplifies to:10x^2 + 7xySo now, the entire expression becomes:(10x^2 + 7xy) √∑ (2x)Which can also be written as (10x^2 + 7xy) / (2x)I can factor out an x from the numerator:x(10x + 7y) / (2x)Then, the x in the numerator and denominator cancels out, as long as x ‚â† 0. Since we're given x = -2, which is not zero, that's fine.So, simplifying further:(10x + 7y) / 2Alright, so the simplified expression is (10x + 7y)/2. Now, let's plug in x = -2 and y = 2.First, compute 10x: 10*(-2) = -20Then, compute 7y: 7*2 = 14Add them together: -20 + 14 = -6Now, divide by 2: -6 / 2 = -3So, the value of the expression is -3.Wait, let me go through that again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.Starting with the numerator:(x + 2y)^2 = x^2 + 4xy + 4y^2(3x + y)(3x - y) = 9x^2 - y^2-3y(y - x) = -3y^2 + 3xyAdding them together:x^2 + 4xy + 4y^2 + 9x^2 - y^2 - 3y^2 + 3xyCombine like terms:x^2 + 9x^2 = 10x^24xy + 3xy = 7xy4y^2 - y^2 - 3y^2 = 0So numerator is 10x^2 + 7xyDivide by 2x: (10x^2 + 7xy)/(2x) = (10x + 7y)/2Plugging in x = -2, y = 2:10*(-2) + 7*2 = -20 + 14 = -6-6 / 2 = -3Yep, that seems correct.

The condition is that each ( q_i ) must be a prime number. I need to find the largest possible value of ( n ).Hmm, let's break this down. First, I should probably try to understand how the sequence behaves. Each term is generated by taking the previous term, subtracting 1, cubing it, and then adding 3. So, it's a recursive sequence where each term depends on the cube of the previous term minus 1, plus 3.Since each term has to be prime, I need to make sure that every step of this process results in a prime number. That probably limits the possible starting values ( q_0 ) quite a bit because primes are specific and not every number is prime.Maybe I should start by trying small values of ( q_0 ) and see how far the sequence can go before hitting a composite number. Let's try ( q_0 = 2 ) first because 2 is the smallest prime.Calculating ( q_1 ):( q_1 = (2 - 1)^3 + 3 = 1^3 + 3 = 1 + 3 = 4 ). But 4 is not a prime number. So, ( q_1 ) is 4, which is composite. Therefore, starting with ( q_0 = 2 ) only gives us one prime before it fails.Wait, but the problem says each ( q_i ) for ( i = 1, 2, ldots, n ) must be prime. So, if ( q_1 ) is 4, which is not prime, then ( n ) can't be 1 in this case. So, ( n ) would be 0? But ( n ) is supposed to be a positive integer, right? Or does ( n ) start from 1? Hmm, the problem says \\"for ( i = 1, 2, ldots, n )\\", so if ( q_1 ) is not prime, then ( n ) can't be 1 either. So, maybe ( n ) is 0? But the question is asking for the largest possible ( n ), so maybe 0 isn't the answer.Wait, perhaps I need to consider ( q_0 ) as the starting point, but the primes start from ( q_1 ). So, if ( q_1 ) is not prime, then ( n ) is 0. But maybe there's a starting ( q_0 ) where ( q_1 ) is prime, and so on.Let me try another starting value. How about ( q_0 = 3 )?Calculating ( q_1 ):( q_1 = (3 - 1)^3 + 3 = 2^3 + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11 ). 11 is a prime number. Good.Now, ( q_2 = (11 - 1)^3 + 3 = 10^3 + 3 = 1000 + 3 = 1003 ). Hmm, is 1003 a prime number? Let me check.1003 divided by 17: 17 * 59 is 1003. So, 1003 is 17 * 59, which means it's composite. So, ( q_2 ) is composite. Therefore, starting with ( q_0 = 3 ), we get ( q_1 = 11 ) which is prime, but ( q_2 ) is composite. So, the maximum ( n ) here is 1.Wait, but maybe I can find a starting ( q_0 ) where ( q_1 ), ( q_2 ), and maybe even ( q_3 ) are primes. Let's try ( q_0 = 5 ).Calculating ( q_1 ):( q_1 = (5 - 1)^3 + 3 = 4^3 + 3 = 64 + 3 = 67 ). 67 is prime.Then, ( q_2 = (67 - 1)^3 + 3 = 66^3 + 3 ). 66 cubed is 66*66*66. Let me compute that:66 * 66 = 4356. Then, 4356 * 66. Let's compute 4356 * 60 = 261,360 and 4356 * 6 = 26,136. Adding them together: 261,360 + 26,136 = 287,496. Then, adding 3 gives 287,500 - wait, 287,496 + 3 is 287,499. So, ( q_2 = 287,499 ). Is that a prime number?Well, 287,499. Let me check divisibility. First, it's odd, so not divisible by 2. Sum of digits: 2 + 8 + 7 + 4 + 9 + 9 = 39, which is divisible by 3, so 287,499 is divisible by 3. Therefore, it's composite. So, ( q_2 ) is composite. So, starting with ( q_0 = 5 ), we get ( q_1 = 67 ) prime, ( q_2 ) composite. So, ( n = 1 ).Hmm, maybe try ( q_0 = 4 ). Wait, 4 is not prime, but the problem says ( q_0 ) is a positive integer, not necessarily prime. So, maybe starting with a composite ( q_0 ) could result in primes for ( q_i ).Let me try ( q_0 = 4 ).Calculating ( q_1 ):( q_1 = (4 - 1)^3 + 3 = 3^3 + 3 = 27 + 3 = 30 ). 30 is composite. So, ( q_1 ) is composite, so ( n = 0 ).How about ( q_0 = 1 )?Calculating ( q_1 ):( q_1 = (1 - 1)^3 + 3 = 0^3 + 3 = 0 + 3 = 3 ). 3 is prime.Then, ( q_2 = (3 - 1)^3 + 3 = 2^3 + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11 ). 11 is prime.Next, ( q_3 = (11 - 1)^3 + 3 = 10^3 + 3 = 1000 + 3 = 1003 ). As before, 1003 is 17 * 59, which is composite. So, starting with ( q_0 = 1 ), we get ( q_1 = 3 ), ( q_2 = 11 ), and ( q_3 = 1003 ). So, ( q_3 ) is composite. Therefore, the maximum ( n ) here is 2.Wait, so starting from ( q_0 = 1 ), we get two primes: ( q_1 = 3 ), ( q_2 = 11 ), and then ( q_3 ) is composite. So, ( n = 2 ). That's better than the previous attempts.Is there a starting ( q_0 ) that can give me ( n = 3 )? Let's see.Let me try ( q_0 = 0 ). Wait, ( q_0 ) is a positive integer, so 0 is not allowed. So, starting from ( q_0 = 1 ) gives ( n = 2 ). Maybe another starting value.How about ( q_0 = 6 )?Calculating ( q_1 ):( q_1 = (6 - 1)^3 + 3 = 5^3 + 3 = 125 + 3 = 128 ). 128 is composite.So, ( n = 0 ).How about ( q_0 = 7 )?( q_1 = (7 - 1)^3 + 3 = 6^3 + 3 = 216 + 3 = 219 ). 219 is divisible by 3 (2 + 1 + 9 = 12, which is divisible by 3), so 219 is composite. So, ( n = 0 ).How about ( q_0 = 8 )?( q_1 = (8 - 1)^3 + 3 = 7^3 + 3 = 343 + 3 = 346 ). 346 is even, so composite. ( n = 0 ).How about ( q_0 = 9 )?( q_1 = (9 - 1)^3 + 3 = 8^3 + 3 = 512 + 3 = 515 ). 515 ends with 5, so divisible by 5, composite. ( n = 0 ).How about ( q_0 = 10 )?( q_1 = (10 - 1)^3 + 3 = 9^3 + 3 = 729 + 3 = 732 ). 732 is even, composite. ( n = 0 ).Hmm, seems like starting from ( q_0 = 1 ) gives the best result so far with ( n = 2 ). Let me check if there's another starting point.Wait, maybe ( q_0 = 11 )?Calculating ( q_1 ):( q_1 = (11 - 1)^3 + 3 = 10^3 + 3 = 1000 + 3 = 1003 ). As before, 1003 is composite. So, ( n = 0 ).How about ( q_0 = 12 )?( q_1 = (12 - 1)^3 + 3 = 11^3 + 3 = 1331 + 3 = 1334 ). 1334 is even, composite. ( n = 0 ).Wait, maybe trying larger starting numbers isn't helpful because the cube grows very quickly, making ( q_i ) large and likely composite.Wait, let's think about ( q_0 = 1 ). It gives ( q_1 = 3 ), ( q_2 = 11 ), ( q_3 = 1003 ). So, ( n = 2 ). Is there a way to get ( n = 3 )?Wait, maybe another starting value. Let's try ( q_0 = 13 ).( q_1 = (13 - 1)^3 + 3 = 12^3 + 3 = 1728 + 3 = 1731 ). 1731: sum of digits is 1 + 7 + 3 + 1 = 12, which is divisible by 3, so 1731 is composite. ( n = 0 ).How about ( q_0 = 14 )?( q_1 = (14 - 1)^3 + 3 = 13^3 + 3 = 2197 + 3 = 2200 ). 2200 is even, composite. ( n = 0 ).Wait, maybe ( q_0 = 15 )?( q_1 = (15 - 1)^3 + 3 = 14^3 + 3 = 2744 + 3 = 2747 ). Is 2747 prime?Let me check. 2747: Let's see, it's not even, doesn't end with 5. Let's test divisibility by primes up to sqrt(2747). Sqrt of 2747 is approximately 52.4. So, test primes up to 53.Divide by 3: 2 + 7 + 4 + 7 = 20, not divisible by 3.Divide by 5: Doesn't end with 0 or 5.Divide by 7: 2747 √∑ 7: 7*392 = 2744, so 2747 - 2744 = 3, so remainder 3, not divisible by 7.Divide by 11: 2 - 7 + 4 - 7 = -8, not divisible by 11.Divide by 13: 13*211 = 2743, 2747 - 2743 = 4, not divisible.Divide by 17: 17*161 = 2737, 2747 - 2737 = 10, not divisible.Divide by 19: 19*144 = 2736, 2747 - 2736 = 11, not divisible.Divide by 23: 23*119 = 2737, 2747 - 2737 = 10, not divisible.Divide by 29: 29*94 = 2726, 2747 - 2726 = 21, not divisible.Divide by 31: 31*88 = 2728, 2747 - 2728 = 19, not divisible.Divide by 37: 37*74 = 2738, 2747 - 2738 = 9, not divisible.Divide by 41: 41*67 = 2747? Let's check: 40*67 = 2680, plus 1*67 = 2680 + 67 = 2747. Yes! So, 41*67 = 2747. Therefore, 2747 is composite. So, ( q_1 = 2747 ) is composite. So, ( n = 0 ).Hmm, seems like starting from ( q_0 = 1 ) is the only way to get two primes. Let me try another approach.Maybe instead of starting with ( q_0 ), I can work backwards. Suppose I want ( q_n ) to be prime. Then ( q_{n-1} ) must satisfy ( q_n = (q_{n-1} - 1)^3 + 3 ). So, if ( q_n ) is prime, then ( (q_{n-1} - 1)^3 = q_n - 3 ). So, ( q_{n-1} - 1 ) must be the cube root of ( q_n - 3 ). Since ( q_{n-1} ) is an integer, ( q_n - 3 ) must be a perfect cube.So, for each ( q_i ), ( q_i - 3 ) must be a perfect cube. Let's denote ( q_i - 3 = k_i^3 ), where ( k_i ) is a positive integer. Then, ( q_i = k_i^3 + 3 ). Also, since ( q_i ) is prime, ( k_i^3 + 3 ) must be prime.So, starting from the end, if I can find a prime ( q_n ) such that ( q_n - 3 ) is a perfect cube, then ( q_{n-1} = k_n + 1 ). Then, ( q_{n-1} ) must also satisfy ( q_{n-1} - 3 ) is a perfect cube, and so on.So, let's try to find primes where ( q - 3 ) is a perfect cube.Let me list some small primes and check if ( q - 3 ) is a cube.Primes: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, 101, 103, 107, 109, 113, etc.Check each:- 2: 2 - 3 = -1, not a cube (since we're considering positive integers, negative cubes aren't considered here).- 3: 3 - 3 = 0, which is 0^3, but 0 is not positive. So, maybe not.- 5: 5 - 3 = 2, not a cube.- 7: 7 - 3 = 4, not a cube.- 11: 11 - 3 = 8, which is 2^3. So, 11 is a prime where ( q - 3 ) is a cube.- 13: 13 - 3 = 10, not a cube.- 17: 17 - 3 = 14, not a cube.- 19: 19 - 3 = 16, not a cube.- 23: 23 - 3 = 20, not a cube.- 29: 29 - 3 = 26, not a cube.- 31: 31 - 3 = 28, not a cube.- 37: 37 - 3 = 34, not a cube.- 41: 41 - 3 = 38, not a cube.- 43: 43 - 3 = 40, not a cube.- 47: 47 - 3 = 44, not a cube.- 53: 53 - 3 = 50, not a cube.- 59: 59 - 3 = 56, not a cube.- 61: 61 - 3 = 58, not a cube.- 67: 67 - 3 = 64, which is 4^3. So, 67 is another prime where ( q - 3 ) is a cube.- 71: 71 - 3 = 68, not a cube.- 73: 73 - 3 = 70, not a cube.- 79: 79 - 3 = 76, not a cube.- 83: 83 - 3 = 80, not a cube.- 89: 89 - 3 = 86, not a cube.- 97: 97 - 3 = 94, not a cube.- 101: 101 - 3 = 98, not a cube.- 103: 103 - 3 = 100, not a cube.- 107: 107 - 3 = 104, not a cube.- 109: 109 - 3 = 106, not a cube.- 113: 113 - 3 = 110, not a cube.So, the primes where ( q - 3 ) is a cube are 11 and 67. Let's note that.So, if ( q_n ) is 11, then ( q_{n-1} = k_n + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3 ). Then, ( q_{n-1} = 3 ). Now, check if ( q_{n-1} - 3 ) is a cube: 3 - 3 = 0, which is 0^3, but 0 is not positive. So, we can't go further back from 3.Alternatively, if ( q_n = 67 ), then ( k_n = 4 ), so ( q_{n-1} = 4 + 1 = 5 ). Then, check ( q_{n-1} - 3 = 5 - 3 = 2 ), which is not a cube. So, we can't go further back from 5.Wait, but earlier, when I started with ( q_0 = 1 ), I got ( q_1 = 3 ), ( q_2 = 11 ), ( q_3 = 1003 ). So, 11 is a prime where ( q - 3 ) is a cube, but 3 is not, because 3 - 3 = 0, which is a cube but 0 is not positive. So, maybe 3 is a special case.Wait, but in the sequence, ( q_0 = 1 ), ( q_1 = 3 ), which is prime, ( q_2 = 11 ), which is prime, ( q_3 = 1003 ), which is composite. So, that gives ( n = 2 ).But when working backwards, starting from 11, we get ( q_{n-1} = 3 ), but 3 - 3 = 0, which is a cube, but 0 isn't positive. So, maybe 3 is the starting point, but since ( q_0 ) can be 1, which is positive, we can have ( q_1 = 3 ).So, perhaps the maximum ( n ) is 2, achieved by starting at ( q_0 = 1 ).Wait, but let me check if there's another prime beyond 11 and 67 where ( q - 3 ) is a cube.Looking at larger primes:- 127: 127 - 3 = 124, not a cube.- 131: 131 - 3 = 128, which is 5.04^3? Wait, 5^3 is 125, 6^3 is 216. So, 128 is not a cube.- 137: 137 - 3 = 134, not a cube.- 139: 139 - 3 = 136, not a cube.- 149: 149 - 3 = 146, not a cube.- 151: 151 - 3 = 148, not a cube.- 157: 157 - 3 = 154, not a cube.- 163: 163 - 3 = 160, not a cube.- 167: 167 - 3 = 164, not a cube.- 173: 173 - 3 = 170, not a cube.- 179: 179 - 3 = 176, not a cube.- 181: 181 - 3 = 178, not a cube.- 191: 191 - 3 = 188, not a cube.- 193: 193 - 3 = 190, not a cube.- 197: 197 - 3 = 194, not a cube.- 199: 199 - 3 = 196, which is 14^2, not a cube.- 211: 211 - 3 = 208, not a cube.- 223: 223 - 3 = 220, not a cube.- 227: 227 - 3 = 224, not a cube.- 229: 229 - 3 = 226, not a cube.- 233: 233 - 3 = 230, not a cube.- 239: 239 - 3 = 236, not a cube.- 241: 241 - 3 = 238, not a cube.- 251: 251 - 3 = 248, not a cube.- 257: 257 - 3 = 254, not a cube.- 263: 263 - 3 = 260, not a cube.- 269: 269 - 3 = 266, not a cube.- 271: 271 - 3 = 268, not a cube.- 277: 277 - 3 = 274, not a cube.- 281: 281 - 3 = 278, not a cube.- 283: 283 - 3 = 280, not a cube.- 293: 293 - 3 = 290, not a cube.Hmm, seems like 11 and 67 are the only primes where ( q - 3 ) is a cube. So, that suggests that the only way to have a prime ( q_i ) is if it's either 11 or 67, or if it's 3, which is a special case because ( 3 - 3 = 0 ), which is a cube but not positive.Wait, but in the sequence starting from ( q_0 = 1 ), we get ( q_1 = 3 ), which is prime, and then ( q_2 = 11 ), which is prime, and then ( q_3 = 1003 ), which is composite. So, that gives us two primes after ( q_0 ), so ( n = 2 ).Is there a way to get ( n = 3 )? Let's see.Suppose we have ( q_3 ) as prime. Then, ( q_3 = (q_2 - 1)^3 + 3 ). So, ( q_2 - 1 ) must be the cube root of ( q_3 - 3 ). So, ( q_3 - 3 ) must be a cube. But as we saw, the only primes where ( q - 3 ) is a cube are 11 and 67. So, ( q_3 ) must be 11 or 67.If ( q_3 = 11 ), then ( q_2 = 2 + 1 = 3 ). Then, ( q_2 = 3 ), which is prime. Then, ( q_1 = (3 - 1)^3 + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11 ), which is prime. Then, ( q_0 = (11 - 1)^3 + 3 = 1000 + 3 = 1003 ), which is composite. So, starting from ( q_0 = 1003 ), we get ( q_1 = 11 ), ( q_2 = 3 ), ( q_3 = 11 ). Wait, but ( q_0 = 1003 ) is composite, so that doesn't help us.Alternatively, if ( q_3 = 67 ), then ( q_2 = 4 + 1 = 5 ). Then, ( q_2 = 5 ), which is prime. Then, ( q_1 = (5 - 1)^3 + 3 = 64 + 3 = 67 ), which is prime. Then, ( q_0 = (67 - 1)^3 + 3 = 66^3 + 3 = 287,496 + 3 = 287,499 ), which is composite. So, starting from ( q_0 = 287,499 ), we get ( q_1 = 67 ), ( q_2 = 5 ), ( q_3 = 67 ). But ( q_0 ) is composite, so that doesn't help.Wait, but in the first case, starting from ( q_0 = 1 ), we get ( q_1 = 3 ), ( q_2 = 11 ), ( q_3 = 1003 ). So, ( q_3 ) is composite, but ( q_1 ) and ( q_2 ) are primes. So, ( n = 2 ).Is there a way to have ( q_3 ) be prime? It seems not, because the only primes where ( q - 3 ) is a cube are 11 and 67, and both lead to ( q_0 ) being composite.Therefore, the maximum ( n ) we can achieve is 2, starting from ( q_0 = 1 ).Wait, but let me double-check. If ( q_0 = 1 ), then ( q_1 = 3 ), ( q_2 = 11 ), ( q_3 = 1003 ). So, ( q_1 ) and ( q_2 ) are primes, but ( q_3 ) is composite. So, ( n = 2 ).Is there another starting point where ( n = 3 )? Let's see.Suppose ( q_0 ) is such that ( q_1 ), ( q_2 ), and ( q_3 ) are all primes. Then, ( q_3 = (q_2 - 1)^3 + 3 ) must be prime, so ( q_3 - 3 ) must be a cube. As we saw, only 11 and 67 satisfy this. So, ( q_3 ) must be 11 or 67.If ( q_3 = 11 ), then ( q_2 = 2 + 1 = 3 ). Then, ( q_2 = 3 ), which is prime. Then, ( q_1 = (3 - 1)^3 + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11 ), which is prime. Then, ( q_0 = (11 - 1)^3 + 3 = 1000 + 3 = 1003 ), which is composite. So, ( q_0 ) is composite, but ( q_1 ), ( q_2 ), ( q_3 ) are primes. But since ( q_0 ) is composite, does that affect ( n )?Wait, the problem states that each ( q_i ) for ( i = 1, 2, ldots, n ) must be prime. So, ( q_0 ) can be any positive integer, but ( q_1 ), ( q_2 ), etc., must be prime. So, if ( q_0 = 1003 ), which is composite, but ( q_1 = 11 ), ( q_2 = 3 ), ( q_3 = 11 ), then ( n = 3 ) because ( q_1 ), ( q_2 ), ( q_3 ) are primes. But wait, ( q_3 = 11 ) is prime, but ( q_4 = (11 - 1)^3 + 3 = 1003 ), which is composite. So, ( n = 3 ) because ( q_1 ), ( q_2 ), ( q_3 ) are primes.Wait, but in this case, ( q_0 = 1003 ), which is composite, but the problem only requires ( q_i ) for ( i = 1, 2, ldots, n ) to be prime. So, ( q_0 ) can be composite. So, in this case, starting from ( q_0 = 1003 ), we get ( q_1 = 11 ), ( q_2 = 3 ), ( q_3 = 11 ), ( q_4 = 1003 ). So, ( q_1 ), ( q_2 ), ( q_3 ) are primes, but ( q_4 ) is composite. So, ( n = 3 ).Wait, but is ( q_3 = 11 ) prime? Yes. So, ( n = 3 ) is possible.But wait, let me check the sequence:- ( q_0 = 1003 )- ( q_1 = (1003 - 1)^3 + 3 = 1002^3 + 3 ). Wait, hold on, that's not correct. Wait, no, the formula is ( q_i = (q_{i-1} - 1)^3 + 3 ). So, ( q_1 = (1003 - 1)^3 + 3 = 1002^3 + 3 ). Wait, that's a huge number, definitely composite. So, my mistake earlier.Wait, no, I think I got confused. Let me correct that.If ( q_3 = 11 ), then ( q_2 = 3 ), ( q_1 = 11 ), ( q_0 = 1003 ). So, starting from ( q_0 = 1003 ), we have:- ( q_1 = (1003 - 1)^3 + 3 = 1002^3 + 3 ). That's a very large number, definitely composite.Wait, so my earlier reasoning was flawed. Because if ( q_3 = 11 ), then ( q_2 = 3 ), ( q_1 = 11 ), ( q_0 = 1003 ). But then, ( q_1 = (1003 - 1)^3 + 3 ), which is not 11. So, that doesn't make sense.Wait, no, actually, the sequence is defined as ( q_i = (q_{i-1} - 1)^3 + 3 ). So, if ( q_0 = 1003 ), then ( q_1 = (1003 - 1)^3 + 3 = 1002^3 + 3 ), which is a huge composite number. So, that doesn't help.Wait, perhaps I need to reverse the sequence. If ( q_3 = 11 ), then ( q_2 = 3 ), ( q_1 = 11 ), ( q_0 = 1003 ). But in reality, ( q_1 = (q_0 - 1)^3 + 3 ). So, if ( q_1 = 11 ), then ( q_0 - 1 = sqrt[3]{11 - 3} = sqrt[3]{8} = 2 ). So, ( q_0 = 3 ). Then, ( q_1 = 11 ), ( q_2 = (11 - 1)^3 + 3 = 1000 + 3 = 1003 ), which is composite. So, starting from ( q_0 = 3 ), we get ( q_1 = 11 ), ( q_2 = 1003 ). So, ( n = 1 ).Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me try to map it out.If I want ( q_3 ) to be prime, then ( q_3 = (q_2 - 1)^3 + 3 ). So, ( q_3 - 3 = (q_2 - 1)^3 ). So, ( q_3 - 3 ) must be a cube. As we saw, the only primes where ( q - 3 ) is a cube are 11 and 67.So, if ( q_3 = 11 ), then ( q_2 - 1 = 2 ), so ( q_2 = 3 ). Then, ( q_2 = 3 ), which is prime. Then, ( q_1 = (q_0 - 1)^3 + 3 ). For ( q_2 = 3 ), ( q_1 = (q_0 - 1)^3 + 3 = 3 ). So, ( (q_0 - 1)^3 = 0 ), so ( q_0 - 1 = 0 ), so ( q_0 = 1 ). Then, ( q_1 = 3 ), ( q_2 = 11 ), ( q_3 = 1003 ). So, ( q_3 ) is composite. Therefore, ( n = 2 ).Alternatively, if ( q_3 = 67 ), then ( q_2 - 1 = 4 ), so ( q_2 = 5 ). Then, ( q_2 = 5 ), which is prime. Then, ( q_1 = (q_0 - 1)^3 + 3 = 5 ). So, ( (q_0 - 1)^3 = 2 ). But 2 is not a perfect cube, so ( q_0 ) would not be an integer. Therefore, this path doesn't work.So, the only way to get ( q_3 ) as prime is if ( q_3 = 11 ), but that leads to ( q_0 = 1 ), which gives ( q_1 = 3 ), ( q_2 = 11 ), ( q_3 = 1003 ). So, ( q_3 ) is composite, meaning ( n = 2 ).Therefore, the maximum ( n ) is 2.Wait, but earlier, I thought starting from ( q_0 = 1 ), we get ( q_1 = 3 ), ( q_2 = 11 ), ( q_3 = 1003 ). So, ( q_1 ) and ( q_2 ) are primes, but ( q_3 ) is composite. So, ( n = 2 ).Is there a way to get ( n = 3 )? It seems not, because the next term after 11 is 1003, which is composite. So, the sequence can't go beyond ( n = 2 ).Wait, but let me think again. If ( q_0 = 1 ), ( q_1 = 3 ), ( q_2 = 11 ), ( q_3 = 1003 ). So, ( q_1 ) and ( q_2 ) are primes, but ( q_3 ) is composite. So, ( n = 2 ).Alternatively, if I start from ( q_0 = 3 ), ( q_1 = 11 ), ( q_2 = 1003 ). So, ( n = 1 ).If I start from ( q_0 = 5 ), ( q_1 = 67 ), ( q_2 = 287,499 ), which is composite. So, ( n = 1 ).If I start from ( q_0 = 11 ), ( q_1 = 1003 ), which is composite. So, ( n = 0 ).So, the only way to get ( n = 2 ) is starting from ( q_0 = 1 ). Therefore, the largest possible ( n ) is 2.Wait, but let me check if there's another starting point where ( n = 3 ). Suppose ( q_0 ) is such that ( q_1 ), ( q_2 ), ( q_3 ) are all primes. Then, ( q_3 = (q_2 - 1)^3 + 3 ) must be prime, so ( q_3 - 3 ) must be a cube. As we saw, only 11 and 67 satisfy this. So, ( q_3 ) must be 11 or 67.If ( q_3 = 11 ), then ( q_2 = 3 ). Then, ( q_2 = 3 ), which is prime. Then, ( q_1 = (q_0 - 1)^3 + 3 = 3 ). So, ( (q_0 - 1)^3 = 0 ), so ( q_0 = 1 ). Then, ( q_1 = 3 ), ( q_2 = 11 ), ( q_3 = 1003 ). So, ( q_3 ) is composite. Therefore, ( n = 2 ).If ( q_3 = 67 ), then ( q_2 = 5 ). Then, ( q_2 = 5 ), which is prime. Then, ( q_1 = (q_0 - 1)^3 + 3 = 5 ). So, ( (q_0 - 1)^3 = 2 ). But 2 is not a perfect cube, so ( q_0 ) is not an integer. Therefore, this path doesn't work.Therefore, the maximum ( n ) is 2.Wait, but let me think again. If I start from ( q_0 = 1 ), I get ( q_1 = 3 ), ( q_2 = 11 ), ( q_3 = 1003 ). So, ( q_1 ) and ( q_2 ) are primes, but ( q_3 ) is composite. So, ( n = 2 ).Is there any other starting point where ( n = 3 )? It seems not, because the only primes where ( q - 3 ) is a cube are 11 and 67, and both lead to ( q_0 ) being 1 or non-integer.Therefore, the largest possible ( n ) is 2."},{"question":"If a is a root of the equation x^{2}+x-1=0, then the value of the algebraic expression 2021-2a^{2}-2a is:A: 2019B: 2021C: 2022D: 2023","answer":"Okay, so I have this algebra problem here. It says that if ( a ) is a root of the equation ( x^2 + x - 1 = 0 ), then I need to find the value of the expression ( 2021 - 2a^2 - 2a ). The options are A: 2019, B: 2021, C: 2022, D: 2023. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, since ( a ) is a root of the equation ( x^2 + x - 1 = 0 ), that means when I plug ( a ) into the equation, it should satisfy it. So, substituting ( a ) into the equation gives:( a^2 + a - 1 = 0 )Okay, so that's an equation involving ( a ). Maybe I can use this to simplify the expression I need to find. The expression is ( 2021 - 2a^2 - 2a ). Let me write that down:( 2021 - 2a^2 - 2a )Looking at this, I notice that both ( a^2 ) and ( a ) are present. From the equation above, I can express ( a^2 ) in terms of ( a ). Let me solve for ( a^2 ):From ( a^2 + a - 1 = 0 ), subtract ( a ) and add 1 to both sides:( a^2 = -a + 1 )So, ( a^2 = -a + 1 ). That's useful because I can substitute this into the expression to eliminate ( a^2 ). Let me do that.Replace ( a^2 ) in ( 2021 - 2a^2 - 2a ) with ( -a + 1 ):( 2021 - 2(-a + 1) - 2a )Now, let's simplify this step by step. First, distribute the -2 into the parentheses:( 2021 - 2*(-a) + (-2)*1 - 2a )Which simplifies to:( 2021 + 2a - 2 - 2a )Wait, let me double-check that:-2 times (-a) is +2a, and -2 times 1 is -2. So, yes, that's correct.So now, the expression is:( 2021 + 2a - 2 - 2a )Looking at this, I can see that there are terms with ( a ) and constant terms. Let's combine like terms.First, the constant terms: 2021 and -2. So, 2021 - 2 is 2019.Then, the terms with ( a ): +2a and -2a. Adding those together: 2a - 2a = 0.So, the entire expression simplifies to:( 2019 + 0 = 2019 )Therefore, the value of the expression ( 2021 - 2a^2 - 2a ) is 2019.Let me just verify my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.1. I started with the given equation ( a^2 + a - 1 = 0 ) and solved for ( a^2 ), getting ( a^2 = -a + 1 ). That seems correct.2. Then, I substituted ( a^2 ) into the expression ( 2021 - 2a^2 - 2a ), replacing ( a^2 ) with ( -a + 1 ). That substitution step looks good.3. Distributing the -2 across the parentheses: -2*(-a) is +2a, and -2*1 is -2. So, that gives me +2a - 2. Then, subtracting 2a as per the original expression. So, the expression becomes 2021 + 2a - 2 - 2a.4. Combining constants: 2021 - 2 is 2019. Combining like terms for ( a ): 2a - 2a is 0. So, the total is 2019.Yes, that all checks out. So, the answer should be 2019, which is option A.Wait, just to be thorough, let me consider if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe by directly solving for ( a ) and plugging it into the expression? Although that might be more complicated, but let's try.The equation is ( x^2 + x - 1 = 0 ). Using the quadratic formula, the roots are:( x = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} )Here, ( a = 1 ), ( b = 1 ), ( c = -1 ). So,( x = frac{-1 pm sqrt{1 + 4}}{2} = frac{-1 pm sqrt{5}}{2} )So, the roots are ( frac{-1 + sqrt{5}}{2} ) and ( frac{-1 - sqrt{5}}{2} ). Let me denote ( a = frac{-1 + sqrt{5}}{2} ) for simplicity.Now, let's compute ( 2021 - 2a^2 - 2a ).First, compute ( a^2 ):( a = frac{-1 + sqrt{5}}{2} )So,( a^2 = left( frac{-1 + sqrt{5}}{2} right)^2 = frac{1 - 2sqrt{5} + 5}{4} = frac{6 - 2sqrt{5}}{4} = frac{3 - sqrt{5}}{2} )Now, compute ( 2a^2 ):( 2a^2 = 2 * frac{3 - sqrt{5}}{2} = 3 - sqrt{5} )Compute ( 2a ):( 2a = 2 * frac{-1 + sqrt{5}}{2} = -1 + sqrt{5} )Now, plug these into the expression:( 2021 - 2a^2 - 2a = 2021 - (3 - sqrt{5}) - (-1 + sqrt{5}) )Simplify the expression step by step:First, distribute the negative signs:( 2021 - 3 + sqrt{5} + 1 - sqrt{5} )Combine like terms:Constants: 2021 - 3 + 1 = 2021 - 2 = 2019( sqrt{5} - sqrt{5} = 0 )So, again, the result is 2019.Therefore, regardless of whether I substitute ( a^2 ) in terms of ( a ) or compute it directly using the roots, I end up with the same answer, 2019. So, I feel confident that option A is the correct answer.Just to recap, the key insight was recognizing that since ( a ) is a root of the quadratic equation, I can express ( a^2 ) in terms of ( a ) and substitute it into the given expression, which simplifies the calculation significantly. Trying to compute it directly using the roots also worked, but it was more involved. The substitution method was more straightforward and efficient.I think that's about it. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'm pretty sure the answer is 2019.**Final Answer**boxed{A}"},{"question":"Emily is crafting decorations using a sequence that consists of 4 silver ornaments, 7 gold ornaments, and three times as many blue ornaments as silver ornaments. If the sequence repeats twice per garland and 4 times per wreath, how many ornaments will she need to make 3 garlands and 8 wreaths?","answer":"First, I need to determine the number of each type of ornament in one sequence. Emily uses 4 silver ornaments, 7 gold ornaments, and three times as many blue ornaments as silver ornaments. Since there are 4 silver ornaments, there are 3 times 4, which is 12 blue ornaments.Next, I'll calculate the total number of ornaments in one sequence by adding the silver, gold, and blue ornaments together: 4 + 7 + 12 = 23 ornaments.Emily repeats this sequence twice per garland and four times per wreath. To find the number of ornaments needed for one garland, I'll multiply the sequence total by 2: 23 * 2 = 46 ornaments per garland.

If ( a_{7}=120 ), then ( a_{8} ) equals(A) 128(B) 168(C) 193(D) 194(E) 210 ","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here about a sequence of positive integers that's increasing. The sequence is defined by a recurrence relation: each term is the sum of the two previous terms. Specifically, it says ( a_{n+2} = a_n + a_{n+1} ) for ( n geq 1 ). They also tell me that ( a_7 = 120 ), and I need to find ( a_8 ). The options are (A) 128, (B) 168, (C) 193, (D) 194, and (E) 210.Hmm, so this sequence is similar to the Fibonacci sequence, where each term is the sum of the two before it. But in this case, the starting terms might be different, so it's not necessarily the Fibonacci sequence. Since it's an increasing sequence of positive integers, all the terms must be positive and each term is larger than the one before it.Let me try to write out the terms in terms of the first two terms, which I can call ( a_1 ) and ( a_2 ). Since the sequence is increasing, ( a_1 < a_2 ), and each subsequent term is the sum of the two before it.So, let's define:- ( a_1 = x )- ( a_2 = y )Then,- ( a_3 = a_1 + a_2 = x + y )- ( a_4 = a_2 + a_3 = y + (x + y) = x + 2y )- ( a_5 = a_3 + a_4 = (x + y) + (x + 2y) = 2x + 3y )- ( a_6 = a_4 + a_5 = (x + 2y) + (2x + 3y) = 3x + 5y )- ( a_7 = a_5 + a_6 = (2x + 3y) + (3x + 5y) = 5x + 8y )- ( a_8 = a_6 + a_7 = (3x + 5y) + (5x + 8y) = 8x + 13y )Okay, so we have ( a_7 = 5x + 8y = 120 ). We need to find ( a_8 = 8x + 13y ). So, if I can find the values of x and y, I can compute ( a_8 ).Given that ( a_1 = x ) and ( a_2 = y ) are positive integers with ( x < y ), and all subsequent terms are positive integers as well. So, 5x + 8y = 120.I need to find positive integers x and y such that 5x + 8y = 120, with x < y.Let me solve for one variable in terms of the other. Let's solve for x:5x = 120 - 8yx = (120 - 8y)/5Since x must be a positive integer, (120 - 8y) must be divisible by 5, and the result must be positive.So, (120 - 8y) mod 5 must be 0.120 mod 5 is 0, so 8y mod 5 must also be 0.8 mod 5 is 3, so 3y mod 5 must be 0.Therefore, 3y must be divisible by 5, which implies that y must be divisible by 5 because 3 and 5 are coprime.So, y = 5k, where k is a positive integer.Let me substitute y = 5k into the equation:x = (120 - 8*(5k))/5 = (120 - 40k)/5 = 24 - 8kSo, x = 24 - 8kSince x must be a positive integer, 24 - 8k > 0So, 24 > 8k => 3 > k => k < 3Since k is a positive integer, k can be 1 or 2.Let's check k=1:y = 5*1 = 5x = 24 - 8*1 = 16But wait, x = 16 and y = 5. But the sequence is increasing, so ( a_1 = 16 ) and ( a_2 = 5 ). But 16 > 5, which contradicts the fact that the sequence is increasing. So, this can't be.Wait, that doesn't make sense. If ( a_1 = 16 ) and ( a_2 = 5 ), then ( a_1 > a_2 ), which would make the sequence decreasing at the start, which is not allowed because it's an increasing sequence. So, k=1 is invalid.Let's try k=2:y = 5*2 = 10x = 24 - 8*2 = 24 - 16 = 8So, x = 8, y = 10. Now, ( a_1 = 8 ), ( a_2 = 10 ). Since 8 < 10, this is acceptable.Let me check if this gives us ( a_7 = 120 ).Compute the terms:- ( a_1 = 8 )- ( a_2 = 10 )- ( a_3 = 8 + 10 = 18 )- ( a_4 = 10 + 18 = 28 )- ( a_5 = 18 + 28 = 46 )- ( a_6 = 28 + 46 = 74 )- ( a_7 = 46 + 74 = 120 )Yes, that works. So, x=8, y=10.Therefore, ( a_8 = a_6 + a_7 = 74 + 120 = 194 ). So, the answer should be D) 194.Wait, but let me double-check. Maybe there's another possible value for k?Wait, k=3 would give y=15, x=24 - 24=0, which is invalid because x must be positive. So, k=3 is invalid. So, only k=2 is valid, which gives x=8, y=10.Therefore, ( a_8 = 194 ), which is option D.But hold on, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in my calculations.Compute ( a_8 = 8x + 13y ). Since x=8 and y=10,( a_8 = 8*8 + 13*10 = 64 + 130 = 194 ). Yep, that's correct.Alternatively, if I compute ( a_8 = a_7 + a_6 = 120 + 74 = 194 ). Same result.So, seems solid.Wait, but just to be thorough, is there another possible pair (x, y) that could satisfy 5x + 8y = 120 with x < y?We found y must be a multiple of 5, so y=5k.But when k=1, y=5, x=16, which violates x < y.k=2, y=10, x=8, which is x < y.k=3, y=15, x=0, which is invalid.k=0, y=0, which is invalid.So, only k=2 is valid. So, only one solution.Therefore, ( a_8 = 194 ).So, the answer is D) 194.**Final Answer**boxed{D}"},{"question":"Calculate the limit of the function:[lim _{x rightarrow 3} frac{sin left(sqrt{2 x^{2}-3 x-5}-sqrt{1+x}right)}{ln (x-1)-ln (x+1)+ln 2}]","answer":"Alright, so I have this limit problem to solve:[lim _{x rightarrow 3} frac{sin left(sqrt{2 x^{2}-3 x-5}-sqrt{1+x}right)}{ln (x-1)-ln (x+1)+ln 2}]Hmm, okay. Let me try to figure this out step by step. First, I remember that when dealing with limits, especially as x approaches a certain value, I should check if plugging in the value directly gives me an indeterminate form like 0/0 or something else. If it does, I might need to use L‚ÄôHospital‚Äôs Rule or some other method like expanding into Taylor series or manipulating the expression.So, let me plug x = 3 into the numerator and denominator separately.Starting with the numerator:[sin left(sqrt{2(3)^2 - 3(3) - 5} - sqrt{1 + 3}right)]Calculating inside the square roots:First square root: 2*(9) - 9 -5 = 18 -9 -5 = 4. So sqrt(4) is 2.Second square root: 1 + 3 = 4, so sqrt(4) is 2.So the argument inside the sine function is 2 - 2 = 0.Thus, the numerator becomes sin(0) which is 0.Now, the denominator:[ln(3 - 1) - ln(3 + 1) + ln 2 = ln(2) - ln(4) + ln(2)]Simplify that:ln(2) - ln(4) + ln(2) = 2 ln(2) - ln(4)But ln(4) is ln(2^2) = 2 ln(2). So:2 ln(2) - 2 ln(2) = 0.So both numerator and denominator are 0 when x approaches 3. That means we have a 0/0 indeterminate form, which suggests that L‚ÄôHospital‚Äôs Rule might be applicable here.Alright, so I need to take the derivatives of the numerator and the denominator with respect to x and then take the limit as x approaches 3.Let me denote the numerator as N(x) and the denominator as D(x):N(x) = sin(sqrt(2x¬≤ - 3x -5) - sqrt(1 + x))D(x) = ln(x - 1) - ln(x + 1) + ln(2)So, I need to find N‚Äô(x) and D‚Äô(x).Starting with N‚Äô(x):The derivative of sin(u) is cos(u) * u‚Äô, where u = sqrt(2x¬≤ - 3x -5) - sqrt(1 + x).So, N‚Äô(x) = cos(u) * [ derivative of sqrt(2x¬≤ - 3x -5) - derivative of sqrt(1 + x) ]Let me compute each derivative separately.First, derivative of sqrt(2x¬≤ - 3x -5):Let me denote f(x) = sqrt(2x¬≤ - 3x -5). Then f‚Äô(x) = (1/(2 sqrt(2x¬≤ - 3x -5))) * (4x - 3). Wait, hold on, the derivative of sqrt(g(x)) is (g‚Äô(x))/(2 sqrt(g(x))).So, g(x) = 2x¬≤ - 3x -5, so g‚Äô(x) = 4x - 3. Thus, f‚Äô(x) = (4x - 3)/(2 sqrt(2x¬≤ - 3x -5)).Similarly, derivative of sqrt(1 + x):Let me denote h(x) = sqrt(1 + x). Then h‚Äô(x) = (1)/(2 sqrt(1 + x)).So, putting it together, N‚Äô(x) is:cos(u) * [ (4x - 3)/(2 sqrt(2x¬≤ - 3x -5)) - 1/(2 sqrt(1 + x)) ]Now, moving on to D‚Äô(x):D(x) = ln(x - 1) - ln(x + 1) + ln(2)Derivative of ln(x - 1) is 1/(x - 1), derivative of -ln(x + 1) is -1/(x + 1), and derivative of ln(2) is 0.So, D‚Äô(x) = 1/(x - 1) - 1/(x + 1)Simplify that:1/(x - 1) - 1/(x + 1) = [ (x + 1) - (x - 1) ] / [ (x - 1)(x + 1) ] = (x +1 -x +1)/(x¬≤ -1) = 2/(x¬≤ -1)So, D‚Äô(x) = 2/(x¬≤ -1)Alright, so now, according to L‚ÄôHospital‚Äôs Rule, the limit becomes:lim_{x‚Üí3} [N‚Äô(x)/D‚Äô(x)] = lim_{x‚Üí3} [ cos(u) * ( (4x -3)/(2 sqrt(2x¬≤ -3x -5)) - 1/(2 sqrt(1 + x)) ) / (2/(x¬≤ -1)) ]Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but let's try to simplify it step by step.First, note that u = sqrt(2x¬≤ -3x -5) - sqrt(1 + x). When x approaches 3, as we saw earlier, u approaches 0. So, cos(u) approaches cos(0) = 1. So, near x=3, cos(u) is approximately 1. So, maybe we can approximate cos(u) as 1 for the purposes of evaluating the limit? Or perhaps we can just compute it exactly.But let me see. Let me write the expression:[ cos(u) * ( (4x -3)/(2 sqrt(2x¬≤ -3x -5)) - 1/(2 sqrt(1 + x)) ) ] / (2/(x¬≤ -1))Which can be rewritten as:cos(u) * [ (4x -3)/(2 sqrt(2x¬≤ -3x -5)) - 1/(2 sqrt(1 + x)) ] * (x¬≤ -1)/2So, simplifying, we have:cos(u) * (x¬≤ -1)/2 * [ (4x -3)/(2 sqrt(2x¬≤ -3x -5)) - 1/(2 sqrt(1 + x)) ]Hmm, perhaps we can factor out the 1/2:cos(u) * (x¬≤ -1)/2 * [ (4x -3)/(2 sqrt(2x¬≤ -3x -5)) - 1/(2 sqrt(1 + x)) ] = cos(u) * (x¬≤ -1)/2 * [ ( (4x -3)/sqrt(2x¬≤ -3x -5) - 1/sqrt(1 + x) ) / 2 ]Wait, that's getting a bit messy. Maybe instead of trying to factor out, let me compute each part step by step.First, let me compute each term inside the brackets:(4x -3)/(2 sqrt(2x¬≤ -3x -5)) and 1/(2 sqrt(1 + x))Compute each at x=3:First term: (4*3 -3)/(2 sqrt(2*(9) - 3*3 -5)) = (12 -3)/(2 sqrt(18 -9 -5)) = 9/(2 sqrt(4)) = 9/(2*2) = 9/4Second term: 1/(2 sqrt(1 +3)) = 1/(2*2) = 1/4So, the difference is 9/4 - 1/4 = 8/4 = 2.So, the expression inside the brackets is 2.Then, cos(u) as x approaches 3 is cos(0) = 1.And (x¬≤ -1)/2 at x=3 is (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4.So, putting it all together: 1 * 4 * 2 = 8.Wait, hold on, let me verify:Wait, the expression is:cos(u) * [ (4x -3)/(2 sqrt(2x¬≤ -3x -5)) - 1/(2 sqrt(1 + x)) ] * (x¬≤ -1)/2At x=3:cos(u) = 1[ (4*3 -3)/(2 sqrt(2*9 -9 -5)) - 1/(2 sqrt(4)) ] = [9/(2*2) - 1/(2*2)] = [9/4 - 1/4] = 8/4 = 2(x¬≤ -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 4So, 1 * 2 * 4 = 8.Therefore, the limit is 8.Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the algebra.Wait, so N‚Äô(x) is cos(u) times [ (4x -3)/(2 sqrt(2x¬≤ -3x -5)) - 1/(2 sqrt(1 + x)) ]And D‚Äô(x) is 2/(x¬≤ -1)So, N‚Äô(x)/D‚Äô(x) is [ cos(u) * ( (4x -3)/(2 sqrt(2x¬≤ -3x -5)) - 1/(2 sqrt(1 + x)) ) ] / (2/(x¬≤ -1)) )Which is equal to cos(u) * ( (4x -3)/(2 sqrt(2x¬≤ -3x -5)) - 1/(2 sqrt(1 + x)) ) * (x¬≤ -1)/2So, yes, that's correct.So, as x approaches 3, cos(u) approaches 1, and the rest of the terms evaluate to 2 * 4 = 8.So, the limit is 8.Wait, but let me think again. Is this correct?Alternatively, maybe I should use another approach, like expanding the numerator and denominator into their Taylor series around x=3, which might make the computation more straightforward.Let me try that.First, let me set t = x - 3, so as x approaches 3, t approaches 0.So, express everything in terms of t.But maybe that's more complicated. Alternatively, since both numerator and denominator approach 0, perhaps I can use the small angle approximation for sine, which is sin(z) ‚âà z when z is near 0.Similarly, for the denominator, perhaps I can expand the logarithms into their Taylor series around x=3.Let me try that.So, numerator: sin(sqrt(2x¬≤ -3x -5) - sqrt(1 +x)) ‚âà sqrt(2x¬≤ -3x -5) - sqrt(1 +x) when x is near 3.So, the numerator is approximately equal to sqrt(2x¬≤ -3x -5) - sqrt(1 +x).Denominator: ln(x -1) - ln(x +1) + ln(2). Let me see if I can simplify this.Wait, ln(x -1) - ln(x +1) + ln(2) = ln( (x -1)/(x +1) ) + ln(2) = ln( 2*(x -1)/(x +1) )So, that's ln(2*(x -1)/(x +1)).So, the denominator is ln(2*(x -1)/(x +1)).So, perhaps I can write the limit as:lim_{x‚Üí3} [sqrt(2x¬≤ -3x -5) - sqrt(1 +x)] / ln(2*(x -1)/(x +1))Hmm, that might be a simpler expression to handle.So, let me denote A = sqrt(2x¬≤ -3x -5) - sqrt(1 +x), and B = ln(2*(x -1)/(x +1)).So, the limit is A/B as x‚Üí3.Now, since both A and B approach 0 as x‚Üí3, we can apply L‚ÄôHospital‚Äôs Rule again, but perhaps it's better to expand A and B into their Taylor series around x=3.Let me try that.First, let me compute A = sqrt(2x¬≤ -3x -5) - sqrt(1 +x)Let me compute each square root separately.Compute sqrt(2x¬≤ -3x -5) near x=3.Let me denote f(x) = sqrt(2x¬≤ -3x -5). Let me compute f(3) = sqrt(18 -9 -5) = sqrt(4) = 2.Compute f‚Äô(x) = (4x -3)/(2 sqrt(2x¬≤ -3x -5)). At x=3, f‚Äô(3) = (12 -3)/(2*2) = 9/4.Similarly, f''(x) would be needed if I need a second-order expansion, but maybe first-order is enough.Similarly, for g(x) = sqrt(1 +x). At x=3, g(3)=2.g‚Äô(x) = 1/(2 sqrt(1 +x)). At x=3, g‚Äô(3)=1/(2*2)=1/4.So, expanding f(x) around x=3:f(x) ‚âà f(3) + f‚Äô(3)(x -3) = 2 + (9/4)(x -3)Similarly, g(x) ‚âà g(3) + g‚Äô(3)(x -3) = 2 + (1/4)(x -3)Therefore, A = f(x) - g(x) ‚âà [2 + (9/4)(x -3)] - [2 + (1/4)(x -3)] = (9/4 -1/4)(x -3) = (8/4)(x -3) = 2(x -3)So, A ‚âà 2(x -3)Now, let's compute B = ln(2*(x -1)/(x +1)).Let me write this as ln(2) + ln(x -1) - ln(x +1).Compute each term near x=3.Let me set t = x -3, so x = 3 + t, t‚Üí0.So, ln(x -1) = ln(2 + t), ln(x +1) = ln(4 + t).So, B = ln(2) + ln(2 + t) - ln(4 + t)Compute the expansion of ln(2 + t) and ln(4 + t) around t=0.We know that ln(a + t) ‚âà ln(a) + t/a - t¬≤/(2a¬≤) + ...So, ln(2 + t) ‚âà ln(2) + t/2 - t¬≤/(8) + ...Similarly, ln(4 + t) ‚âà ln(4) + t/4 - t¬≤/(32) + ...Therefore, B = ln(2) + [ln(2) + t/2 - t¬≤/8] - [ln(4) + t/4 - t¬≤/32] + higher order terms.Simplify:ln(2) + ln(2) + t/2 - t¬≤/8 - ln(4) - t/4 + t¬≤/32Note that ln(4) = 2 ln(2), so:ln(2) + ln(2) - 2 ln(2) = 0t/2 - t/4 = t/4-t¬≤/8 + t¬≤/32 = (-4t¬≤ + t¬≤)/32 = (-3t¬≤)/32So, B ‚âà t/4 - (3 t¬≤)/32 + ...Therefore, B ‚âà (x -3)/4 - 3(x -3)^2 /32 + ...So, up to first order, B ‚âà (x -3)/4Therefore, the limit becomes:lim_{x‚Üí3} A / B ‚âà lim_{x‚Üí3} [2(x -3)] / [ (x -3)/4 ] = lim_{x‚Üí3} 2(x -3) * [4 / (x -3)] = lim_{x‚Üí3} 8 = 8So, that confirms the earlier result.Alternatively, using the expansion, we see that A ‚âà 2(x -3) and B ‚âà (x -3)/4, so their ratio is 8.Therefore, the limit is 8.Wait, but just to make sure, let me compute the limit using L‚ÄôHospital‚Äôs Rule again, just to cross-verify.Earlier, we had:lim_{x‚Üí3} [N‚Äô(x)/D‚Äô(x)] = lim_{x‚Üí3} [ cos(u) * ( (4x -3)/(2 sqrt(2x¬≤ -3x -5)) - 1/(2 sqrt(1 + x)) ) / (2/(x¬≤ -1)) ]At x=3, cos(u)=1, as u=0.Compute the numerator inside the brackets:(4*3 -3)/(2*sqrt(2*9 -9 -5)) - 1/(2*sqrt(4)) = (12 -3)/(2*2) - 1/(2*2) = 9/4 - 1/4 = 8/4 = 2.Denominator: 2/(9 -1) = 2/8 = 1/4.So, the expression becomes:1 * (2) / (1/4) = 2 * 4 = 8.Yes, same result.So, both methods give the same answer, which is 8.Therefore, the limit is 8.**Final Answer**boxed{8}"},{"question":"The equation x^2 + mx + n = 0 (m, n in mathbb{R}) has a root of -3 + 2i. Find the value of m.","answer":"Okay, so I have this quadratic equation: (x^2 + mx + n = 0), where (m) and (n) are real numbers. And I know that one of the roots is (-3 + 2i). I need to find the value of (m). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that for polynomials with real coefficients, if there's a complex root, its complex conjugate must also be a root. That makes sense because the coefficients are real, so the imaginary parts have to cancel out somehow. So, if (-3 + 2i) is a root, then (-3 - 2i) must also be a root. That gives me both roots of the quadratic equation.Now, since I know both roots, I can use Vieta's formulas to find the coefficients (m) and (n). Vieta's formulas relate the sum and product of the roots to the coefficients of the polynomial. For a quadratic equation (x^2 + bx + c = 0), the sum of the roots is (-b) and the product is (c). Wait, in my equation, it's (x^2 + mx + n = 0), so the sum of the roots should be (-m) and the product should be (n).Let me write that down:Sum of roots: ((-3 + 2i) + (-3 - 2i))Product of roots: ((-3 + 2i)(-3 - 2i))Calculating the sum first. Let's add the two roots:[(-3 + 2i) + (-3 - 2i) = (-3 - 3) + (2i - 2i) = -6 + 0i = -6]So the sum of the roots is (-6). According to Vieta's formula, this should be equal to (-m). So:[-6 = -m implies m = 6]Wait, that seems straightforward. But let me double-check by calculating the product of the roots as well, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake.Calculating the product:[(-3 + 2i)(-3 - 2i)]This looks like the product of a binomial and its conjugate, which should be a difference of squares. So:[(-3)^2 - (2i)^2 = 9 - 4i^2]Since (i^2 = -1), this becomes:[9 - 4(-1) = 9 + 4 = 13]So the product of the roots is 13. According to Vieta's formula, this should be equal to (n). So (n = 13).But the question only asks for (m), which we found to be 6. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any errors.1. Given quadratic equation with real coefficients, so complex roots come in conjugate pairs.2. Therefore, if (-3 + 2i) is a root, so is (-3 - 2i).3. Sum of roots: (-3 + 2i -3 -2i = -6), which equals (-m), so (m = 6).4. Product of roots: ((-3)^2 - (2i)^2 = 9 - (-4) = 13), which equals (n), so (n = 13).Everything seems to check out. I don't think I made any calculation errors here. The sum was straightforward, and the product used the difference of squares formula correctly, remembering that (i^2 = -1).Just to be thorough, maybe I can reconstruct the quadratic equation using the roots and see if it matches (x^2 + 6x + 13 = 0).If the roots are (-3 + 2i) and (-3 - 2i), then the quadratic can be written as:[(x - (-3 + 2i))(x - (-3 - 2i)) = (x + 3 - 2i)(x + 3 + 2i)]Multiplying these two binomials:First, multiply (x + 3) with (x + 3): (x^2 + 6x + 9).Then, the cross terms: (-2i cdot x + 2i cdot x) which cancel out to 0.Then, the last terms: (-2i cdot 2i = -4i^2 = -4(-1) = 4).Wait, hold on, maybe I should do it step by step.Let me expand ((x + 3 - 2i)(x + 3 + 2i)):First, multiply (x) with each term in the second binomial:(x cdot x = x^2)(x cdot 3 = 3x)(x cdot 2i = 2i x)Then, multiply 3 with each term in the second binomial:(3 cdot x = 3x)(3 cdot 3 = 9)(3 cdot 2i = 6i)Then, multiply (-2i) with each term in the second binomial:(-2i cdot x = -2i x)(-2i cdot 3 = -6i)(-2i cdot 2i = -4i^2)Now, let's combine all these terms:(x^2 + 3x + 2i x + 3x + 9 + 6i - 2i x - 6i - 4i^2)Now, let's combine like terms:- (x^2)- (3x + 3x = 6x)- (2i x - 2i x = 0) (they cancel out)- (9)- (6i - 6i = 0) (they cancel out)- (-4i^2)So, we're left with:(x^2 + 6x + 9 - 4i^2)Since (i^2 = -1), (-4i^2 = -4(-1) = 4). So:(x^2 + 6x + 9 + 4 = x^2 + 6x + 13)Which is exactly the equation we started with: (x^2 + mx + n = 0), so (m = 6) and (n = 13). That confirms my earlier calculations.Therefore, I'm confident that (m = 6) is the correct answer.**Final Answer**The value of (m) is boxed{6}."},{"question":"How many ordered pairs of integers (a,b) satisfy all of the following inequalities? [ begin{aligned} a^2 + b^2 &< 16  a^2 + b^2 &< 8a  a^2 + b^2 &< 8b end{aligned}]","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of ordered pairs of integers (a, b) that satisfy three inequalities:1. ( a^2 + b^2 < 16 )2. ( a^2 + b^2 < 8a )3. ( a^2 + b^2 < 8b )Hmm, let me try to visualize what's going on here. Each inequality represents a region in the coordinate plane, and I need to find the integer points that lie in the intersection of all three regions.Starting with the first inequality: ( a^2 + b^2 < 16 ). That's the interior of a circle centered at the origin with radius 4, right? Because 16 is 4 squared. So, all points (a, b) that are inside this circle.The second inequality is ( a^2 + b^2 < 8a ). Let me rearrange this to see if I can interpret it as a circle. Subtract 8a from both sides:( a^2 - 8a + b^2 < 0 )Now, I can complete the square for the a terms. Let's see:( a^2 - 8a = (a - 4)^2 - 16 )So substituting back:( (a - 4)^2 - 16 + b^2 < 0 )Which simplifies to:( (a - 4)^2 + b^2 < 16 )Oh, that's a circle centered at (4, 0) with radius 4. So, the second inequality represents the interior of this circle.Similarly, the third inequality is ( a^2 + b^2 < 8b ). Let me do the same thing. Subtract 8b from both sides:( a^2 + b^2 - 8b < 0 )Completing the square for the b terms:( b^2 - 8b = (b - 4)^2 - 16 )Substituting back:( a^2 + (b - 4)^2 - 16 < 0 )Which simplifies to:( a^2 + (b - 4)^2 < 16 )So, that's a circle centered at (0, 4) with radius 4.Alright, so now I have three circles:1. Centered at (0, 0) with radius 4.2. Centered at (4, 0) with radius 4.3. Centered at (0, 4) with radius 4.I need to find integer points (a, b) that lie inside all three circles. That means the point has to be inside the intersection of these three circles.Let me sketch this mentally. The three circles intersect each other. The first circle is centered at the origin, the second at (4, 0), and the third at (0, 4). Each pair of circles will intersect somewhere. The intersection of all three would be a sort of lens-shaped region near the center where all three circles overlap.But since we're dealing with integer coordinates, maybe the overlapping region is small enough that I can list all possible integer points within it.First, let's figure out the bounds for a and b. Since all three circles have radius 4, and they're centered at (0,0), (4,0), and (0,4), the overlapping region is probably somewhere near (2, 2). Let's see.But let's approach this step by step.First, from the first inequality ( a^2 + b^2 < 16 ), both a and b must satisfy ( |a| < 4 ) and ( |b| < 4 ), but actually, since the circle is radius 4, a and b can be from -3 to 3, because 4 squared is 16, but since it's less than 16, the maximum integer value for a or b is 3.Wait, actually, 4^2 is 16, so if a is 4, then ( a^2 = 16 ), which is not less than 16, so a can be at most 3. Similarly, a can be as low as -3 because (-4)^2 is also 16.But wait, let's check the other inequalities. The second inequality is ( a^2 + b^2 < 8a ). Let's see what this implies for a.Since ( a^2 + b^2 < 8a ), rearranged as ( a^2 - 8a + b^2 < 0 ). As we saw earlier, this is a circle centered at (4, 0). So, for this inequality to hold, the point (a, b) must lie inside this circle.Similarly, the third inequality is ( a^2 + b^2 < 8b ), which is a circle centered at (0, 4). So, the point must lie inside that circle as well.So, let me think about the possible integer values for a and b.Since all three inequalities must hold, let's consider the constraints on a and b.From the second inequality, ( a^2 + b^2 < 8a ). Let's solve for a:( a^2 - 8a + b^2 < 0 )This is a quadratic in a. Let's consider it as:( a^2 - 8a + (b^2) < 0 )The quadratic equation ( a^2 - 8a + b^2 = 0 ) has roots at:( a = [8 ¬± sqrt(64 - 4*1*b^2)] / 2 = [8 ¬± sqrt(64 - 4b^2)] / 2 = 4 ¬± sqrt(16 - b^2) )So, the inequality ( a^2 - 8a + b^2 < 0 ) holds when a is between these two roots:( 4 - sqrt(16 - b^2) < a < 4 + sqrt(16 - b^2) )Similarly, from the third inequality ( a^2 + b^2 < 8b ), solving for b:( b^2 - 8b + a^2 < 0 )Quadratic in b:( b^2 - 8b + a^2 = 0 )Roots:( b = [8 ¬± sqrt(64 - 4a^2)] / 2 = 4 ¬± sqrt(16 - a^2) )So, the inequality holds when:( 4 - sqrt(16 - a^2) < b < 4 + sqrt(16 - a^2) )So, putting it all together, for each integer a, b must satisfy both:1. ( 4 - sqrt(16 - a^2) < b < 4 + sqrt(16 - a^2) )2. ( 4 - sqrt(16 - b^2) < a < 4 + sqrt(16 - b^2) )But since a and b are integers, maybe it's easier to iterate through possible integer values of a and b and check all three inequalities.Given that from the first inequality, a and b are between -3 and 3, but considering the other inequalities, perhaps a and b are positive? Let me check.Looking at the second inequality ( a^2 + b^2 < 8a ). If a is negative, then 8a is negative, but ( a^2 + b^2 ) is always non-negative, so the inequality would require a negative number to be greater than a non-negative number, which is impossible. So, a must be positive.Similarly, from the third inequality ( a^2 + b^2 < 8b ), if b is negative, 8b is negative, and again ( a^2 + b^2 ) is non-negative, so the inequality would require a negative number to be greater than a non-negative number, which is impossible. So, b must be positive.Therefore, both a and b must be positive integers. So, a and b can be 1, 2, 3.Wait, but let me confirm. If a is zero, then 8a is zero, and ( a^2 + b^2 ) is at least zero, so the inequality would require ( a^2 + b^2 < 0 ), which is only possible if a and b are zero. But if a is zero, then from the second inequality, ( 0 + b^2 < 0 ), which implies b must be zero. Similarly, from the third inequality, ( a^2 + 0 < 0 ), which implies a must be zero. So, (0, 0) is a possible point? Let's check all three inequalities:1. ( 0 + 0 < 16 ): True.2. ( 0 + 0 < 0 ): False, because 0 is not less than 0. So, (0, 0) doesn't satisfy the second inequality.Therefore, a and b cannot be zero. So, a and b must be positive integers from 1 to 3.So, possible a: 1, 2, 3Possible b: 1, 2, 3So, let's list all possible ordered pairs (a, b) where a and b are in {1, 2, 3} and check which ones satisfy all three inequalities.Total possible pairs: 9.Let's check each one:1. (1, 1):First inequality: 1 + 1 = 2 < 16: TrueSecond inequality: 2 < 8*1 = 8: TrueThird inequality: 2 < 8*1 = 8: TrueSo, (1,1) is good.2. (1, 2):First: 1 + 4 = 5 < 16: TrueSecond: 5 < 8: TrueThird: 5 < 16: True (Wait, 8b = 16? Wait, 8*2 = 16, so 5 < 16: TrueSo, (1,2) is good.3. (1, 3):First: 1 + 9 = 10 < 16: TrueSecond: 10 < 8: False.

(3, 1):First: 9 + 1 = 10 < 16: TrueSecond: 10 < 24: True (8*3=24)Third: 10 < 8: False. So, (3,1) is out.8. (3, 2):First: 9 + 4 = 13 < 16: TrueSecond: 13 < 24: TrueThird: 13 < 16: TrueSo, (3,2) is good.9. (3, 3):First: 9 + 9 = 18 < 16: False. So, (3,3) is out.So, from the 9 possible pairs, the ones that satisfy all three inequalities are:(1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,2)That's 6 ordered pairs.Wait, let me double-check each of these:(1,1):1. 1+1=2 <16: yes2. 2 <8: yes3. 2 <8: yesGood.(1,2):1. 1+4=5 <16: yes2. 5 <8: yes3. 5 <16: yesGood.(2,1):1. 4+1=5 <16: yes2. 5 <16: yes3. 5 <8: yesGood.(2,2):1. 4+4=8 <16: yes2. 8 <16: yes3. 8 <16: yesGood.(2,3):1. 4+9=13 <16: yes2. 13 <16: yes3. 13 <24: yesGood.(3,2):1. 9+4=13 <16: yes2. 13 <24: yes3. 13 <16: yesGood.So, all 6 are valid.Wait, but let me check if there are any other integer points outside of a and b being 1,2,3 that could satisfy all three inequalities.Earlier, I thought a and b must be positive, but let me confirm.If a is negative, as I thought earlier, the second inequality ( a^2 + b^2 < 8a ) would require a negative number on the right, but the left is positive, so that's impossible. Similarly, if b is negative, the third inequality would fail.What about a=0? Then, from the second inequality, ( 0 + b^2 < 0 ), which is only possible if b=0, but then the third inequality would require ( 0 + 0 < 0 ), which is false. So, a=0 and b=0 is invalid.Similarly, if b=0, same issue.So, indeed, a and b must be positive integers from 1 to 3.Therefore, the only possible ordered pairs are the 6 I found.Wait, but let me think again. Maybe a or b could be 4? Let's check.If a=4, then from the second inequality, ( 16 + b^2 < 32 ), which simplifies to ( b^2 < 16 ). So, b can be from -3 to 3.But from the first inequality, ( 16 + b^2 < 16 ), which would require ( b^2 < 0 ), which is only possible if b=0. But then, from the third inequality, ( 16 + 0 < 0 ), which is false. So, a=4 is invalid.Similarly, if b=4, from the third inequality, ( a^2 + 16 < 32 ), so ( a^2 < 16 ). So, a can be from -3 to 3.But from the first inequality, ( a^2 + 16 < 16 ), which requires ( a^2 < 0 ), which is only possible if a=0. Then, from the second inequality, ( 0 + 16 < 0 ), which is false. So, b=4 is invalid.Therefore, a and b cannot be 4.What about a= -1? Then, from the second inequality, ( 1 + b^2 < -8 ), which is impossible because the left side is positive. Similarly, for other negative a or b, same issue.So, indeed, a and b must be positive integers from 1 to 3, and we've checked all 9 possibilities, resulting in 6 valid ordered pairs.Wait, but let me think again. Maybe I missed some points where a or b is larger, but still satisfies all inequalities. For example, (2,4) or something? But wait, b=4 is invalid as we saw earlier. Similarly, a=4 is invalid.Alternatively, maybe a=1, b=4? But b=4 is invalid because from the first inequality, (1 + 16 =17 <16) is false.Similarly, a=4, b=1: (16 +1=17 <16) is false.So, no, those are invalid.Alternatively, maybe a=2, b=4: (4 + 16=20 <16): false.Nope.So, I think I've covered all possibilities.Therefore, the number of ordered pairs is 6.**Final Answer**The number of ordered pairs is boxed{6}."},{"question":"Ava pays 35/hour for 2 hours per week of guitar lessons and 50/hour for 4 hours a week of singing lessons.

In the first round, Mia spins the hoop 240 times, while Ava spins it 2/3 as many times as Mia. In the second round, Ava spins the hoop 75 more times than Mia. If Mia managed to spin the hoop 3/4 times the number of spins she did in the first round, calculate the total number of spins the two did in the two rounds.","answer":"First, I'll determine the number of spins each participant made in the first round. Mia spun the hoop 240 times. Ava spun it two-thirds as many times as Mia, which is 240 multiplied by 2/3, resulting in 160 spins.Next, for the second round, Mia spun the hoop three-fourths of the number of spins she did in the first round. So, Mia spun 240 multiplied by 3/4, which equals 180 spins. Ava spun 75 more times than Mia in the second round, so Ava spun 180 plus 75, totaling 255 spins.Finally, I'll calculate the total number of spins for both rounds by adding up all the spins. Mia's total is 240 plus 180, which is 420 spins. Ava's total is 160 plus 255, which is 415 spins.

I need to find the value of ( 2a - 3b ). Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.First, since we know the solution ( x = 2 ) and ( y = 1 ), we can substitute these values into both equations to find the values of ( a ) and ( b ). Once we have ( a ) and ( b ), we can easily compute ( 2a - 3b ).Let me write down the equations with the given solution substituted in.Starting with the first equation:[a(2) - b(1) = 4]Simplifying that, we get:[2a - b = 4 quad text{(Equation 1)}]Now, the second equation:[a(2) + b(1) = 2]Simplifying this one:[2a + b = 2 quad text{(Equation 2)}]Okay, so now I have a system of two equations with two variables, ( a ) and ( b ). Let me write them together:1. ( 2a - b = 4 )2. ( 2a + b = 2 )Hmm, maybe I can solve this system by elimination or substitution. Let me try elimination because the coefficients of ( b ) are opposites in the two equations. If I add the two equations together, the ( b ) terms will cancel out.Adding Equation 1 and Equation 2:[(2a - b) + (2a + b) = 4 + 2]Simplify the left side:[2a - b + 2a + b = (2a + 2a) + (-b + b) = 4a + 0 = 4a]And the right side:[4 + 2 = 6]So, we have:[4a = 6]To solve for ( a ), divide both sides by 4:[a = frac{6}{4} = frac{3}{2}]Okay, so ( a = frac{3}{2} ). Now, let's find ( b ). I can substitute ( a ) back into either Equation 1 or Equation 2. Let me choose Equation 2 because the numbers might be simpler.Using Equation 2:[2a + b = 2]Substitute ( a = frac{3}{2} ):[2 times frac{3}{2} + b = 2]Simplify:[3 + b = 2]Subtract 3 from both sides:[b = 2 - 3 = -1]So, ( b = -1 ).Now, let me double-check these values with Equation 1 to make sure I didn't make a mistake.Equation 1:[2a - b = 4]Substitute ( a = frac{3}{2} ) and ( b = -1 ):[2 times frac{3}{2} - (-1) = 3 + 1 = 4]Yes, that works. So, ( a = frac{3}{2} ) and ( b = -1 ) are correct.Now, the question asks for ( 2a - 3b ). Let me compute that.First, compute ( 2a ):[2a = 2 times frac{3}{2} = 3]Then, compute ( 3b ):[3b = 3 times (-1) = -3]So, ( 2a - 3b = 3 - (-3) = 3 + 3 = 6 ).Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me just verify my calculations because sometimes signs can be tricky.Given ( a = frac{3}{2} ) and ( b = -1 ):Compute ( 2a ):[2 times frac{3}{2} = 3]Compute ( 3b ):[3 times (-1) = -3]So, ( 2a - 3b = 3 - (-3) = 3 + 3 = 6 ). Yep, that's correct.Just to be thorough, let me plug ( a ) and ( b ) back into the original system to ensure that the solution ( x = 2 ) and ( y = 1 ) satisfies both equations.First equation:[ax - by = 4]Substitute ( a = frac{3}{2} ), ( b = -1 ), ( x = 2 ), ( y = 1 ):[frac{3}{2} times 2 - (-1) times 1 = 3 + 1 = 4]Which is correct.Second equation:[ax + by = 2]Substitute ( a = frac{3}{2} ), ( b = -1 ), ( x = 2 ), ( y = 1 ):[frac{3}{2} times 2 + (-1) times 1 = 3 - 1 = 2]That also checks out.So, everything seems consistent. Therefore, the value of ( 2a - 3b ) is 6.**Final Answer**The value of ( 2a - 3b ) is boxed{6}."},{"question":"A perfect number is an integer that is equal to the sum of all of its positive divisors, except itself.

I need to find the sum of the first 100 terms of this sequence. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, maybe I should write out the first few terms to see if there's a pattern or cycle. That often helps with sequences defined by recurrence relations. Let me start calculating the terms step by step.Given:a‚ÇÅ = -1a‚ÇÇ = 2Now, using the recurrence relation a_{n+2} = a_{n+1} - a_n:a‚ÇÉ = a‚ÇÇ - a‚ÇÅ = 2 - (-1) = 2 + 1 = 3a‚ÇÑ = a‚ÇÉ - a‚ÇÇ = 3 - 2 = 1a‚ÇÖ = a‚ÇÑ - a‚ÇÉ = 1 - 3 = -2a‚ÇÜ = a‚ÇÖ - a‚ÇÑ = -2 - 1 = -3a‚Çá = a‚ÇÜ - a‚ÇÖ = -3 - (-2) = -3 + 2 = -1a‚Çà = a‚Çá - a‚ÇÜ = -1 - (-3) = -1 + 3 = 2a‚Çâ = a‚Çà - a‚Çá = 2 - (-1) = 2 + 1 = 3a‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ = a‚Çâ - a‚Çà = 3 - 2 = 1Wait a minute, I'm noticing that a‚Çá is -1, which is the same as a‚ÇÅ, and a‚Çà is 2, same as a‚ÇÇ. Then a‚Çâ is 3, same as a‚ÇÉ. So it seems like the sequence is repeating every 6 terms. Let me confirm:a‚ÇÅ = -1a‚ÇÇ = 2a‚ÇÉ = 3a‚ÇÑ = 1a‚ÇÖ = -2a‚ÇÜ = -3a‚Çá = -1 (same as a‚ÇÅ)a‚Çà = 2 (same as a‚ÇÇ)a‚Çâ = 3 (same as a‚ÇÉ)a‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ = 1 (same as a‚ÇÑ)a‚ÇÅ‚ÇÅ = -2 (same as a‚ÇÖ)a‚ÇÅ‚ÇÇ = -3 (same as a‚ÇÜ)a‚ÇÅ‚ÇÉ = -1 (same as a‚Çá and a‚ÇÅ)...Yes, it definitely cycles every 6 terms. So the period is 6. That means the sequence is periodic with period 6. So every block of 6 terms repeats.So, to find the sum of the first 100 terms, I can figure out how many complete cycles of 6 terms are in 100 terms, and then the sum of the remaining terms.First, let's compute the sum of one full period (6 terms):Sum = a‚ÇÅ + a‚ÇÇ + a‚ÇÉ + a‚ÇÑ + a‚ÇÖ + a‚ÇÜ= (-1) + 2 + 3 + 1 + (-2) + (-3)Let me compute step by step:Start with -1 + 2 = 11 + 3 = 44 + 1 = 55 + (-2) = 33 + (-3) = 0So the sum of one period (6 terms) is 0. That's interesting. So every 6 terms, the sum cancels out to zero.Therefore, if I can find how many complete periods are in 100 terms, and then the sum of the remaining terms, that will give me the total sum.Let me compute how many complete periods are in 100 terms. Since each period is 6 terms, I can divide 100 by 6.100 √∑ 6 = 16 with a remainder of 4. Because 16*6 = 96, and 100 - 96 = 4.So there are 16 complete periods, each summing to 0, and then 4 additional terms.Therefore, the sum of the first 100 terms is equal to the sum of the first 4 terms of the sequence.Let me compute the sum of the first 4 terms:Sum = a‚ÇÅ + a‚ÇÇ + a‚ÇÉ + a‚ÇÑ= (-1) + 2 + 3 + 1Compute step by step:-1 + 2 = 11 + 3 = 44 + 1 = 5So the sum of the first 4 terms is 5.Therefore, the sum of the first 100 terms is 5.Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.First, verifying the sequence:a‚ÇÅ = -1a‚ÇÇ = 2a‚ÇÉ = 2 - (-1) = 3a‚ÇÑ = 3 - 2 = 1a‚ÇÖ = 1 - 3 = -2a‚ÇÜ = -2 - 1 = -3a‚Çá = -3 - (-2) = -1a‚Çà = -1 - (-3) = 2Yes, it cycles every 6 terms.Sum of 6 terms: (-1) + 2 + 3 + 1 + (-2) + (-3) = 0. Correct.Number of complete periods in 100 terms: 100 √∑ 6 = 16 with remainder 4. So 16*6=96 terms, sum is 0, then sum of next 4 terms: a‚ÇÅ to a‚ÇÑ.Sum of a‚ÇÅ to a‚ÇÑ: (-1) + 2 + 3 + 1 = 5.

We need to find the minimum distance from Q to the line AB.Alright, so let's start by understanding the setup.1. **Line l passes through P(0,1):** So, the line l has some slope, let's say m, and since it passes through (0,1), its equation is y = m x + 1.2. **Line l intersects the parabola y = x¬≤ at two points A and B:** So, to find points A and B, we can set y = m x + 1 equal to y = x¬≤. That gives the equation x¬≤ = m x + 1, which simplifies to x¬≤ - m x - 1 = 0. This is a quadratic equation in x, so it should have two solutions, which are the x-coordinates of points A and B.3. **Let me denote the x-coordinates of A and B as x‚ÇÅ and x‚ÇÇ:** So, from the quadratic equation x¬≤ - m x - 1 = 0, the solutions are x = [m ¬± sqrt(m¬≤ + 4)] / 2. So, x‚ÇÅ = [m + sqrt(m¬≤ + 4)] / 2 and x‚ÇÇ = [m - sqrt(m¬≤ + 4)] / 2.4. **Coordinates of A and B:** Since y = x¬≤, the coordinates of A are (x‚ÇÅ, x‚ÇÅ¬≤) and of B are (x‚ÇÇ, x‚ÇÇ¬≤).5. **Tangents at A and B:** Now, I need to find the equations of the tangent lines at points A and B on the parabola y = x¬≤.   - The derivative of y = x¬≤ is dy/dx = 2x, so the slope of the tangent at any point (x, x¬≤) is 2x.   - So, the tangent at A has slope 2x‚ÇÅ, and its equation is y - x‚ÇÅ¬≤ = 2x‚ÇÅ(x - x‚ÇÅ). Simplifying, this becomes y = 2x‚ÇÅ x - 2x‚ÇÅ¬≤ + x‚ÇÅ¬≤ = 2x‚ÇÅ x - x‚ÇÅ¬≤.   - Similarly, the tangent at B has slope 2x‚ÇÇ, and its equation is y = 2x‚ÇÇ x - x‚ÇÇ¬≤.6. **Finding point Q where the two tangents intersect:** So, set the two tangent equations equal to each other:   2x‚ÇÅ x - x‚ÇÅ¬≤ = 2x‚ÇÇ x - x‚ÇÇ¬≤   Let's solve for x:   2x‚ÇÅ x - 2x‚ÇÇ x = x‚ÇÅ¬≤ - x‚ÇÇ¬≤   Factor both sides:   2(x‚ÇÅ - x‚ÇÇ)x = (x‚ÇÅ - x‚ÇÇ)(x‚ÇÅ + x‚ÇÇ)   Assuming x‚ÇÅ ‚â† x‚ÇÇ (which they aren't since A and B are distinct), we can divide both sides by (x‚ÇÅ - x‚ÇÇ):   2x = x‚ÇÅ + x‚ÇÇ   So, x = (x‚ÇÅ + x‚ÇÇ)/2   Now, plug this back into one of the tangent equations to find y:   y = 2x‚ÇÅ*( (x‚ÇÅ + x‚ÇÇ)/2 ) - x‚ÇÅ¬≤ = x‚ÇÅ(x‚ÇÅ + x‚ÇÇ) - x‚ÇÅ¬≤ = x‚ÇÅ¬≤ + x‚ÇÅx‚ÇÇ - x‚ÇÅ¬≤ = x‚ÇÅx‚ÇÇ   So, point Q has coordinates ( (x‚ÇÅ + x‚ÇÇ)/2 , x‚ÇÅx‚ÇÇ )7. **Express x‚ÇÅ + x‚ÇÇ and x‚ÇÅx‚ÇÇ in terms of m:** From the quadratic equation x¬≤ - m x - 1 = 0, we know that:   - Sum of roots: x‚ÇÅ + x‚ÇÇ = m   - Product of roots: x‚ÇÅx‚ÇÇ = -1   So, substituting these into the coordinates of Q:   Q = ( m/2 , -1 )   Wait, that's interesting. So, regardless of the slope m, point Q is always (m/2, -1). Hmm, but that seems a bit strange because m can vary, so Q moves along the line y = -1 as m changes.8. **Line AB:** We need the equation of line AB. Since points A and B lie on the parabola and on line l, which is y = m x + 1. So, line AB is just line l, which is y = m x + 1.   Wait, but actually, points A and B are on both the parabola and line l, so line AB is indeed line l. So, the equation of AB is y = m x + 1.9. **Distance from Q to line AB:** So, we need to compute the distance from point Q(m/2, -1) to the line AB: y = m x + 1.   The formula for the distance from a point (x‚ÇÄ, y‚ÇÄ) to the line a x + b y + c = 0 is |a x‚ÇÄ + b y‚ÇÄ + c| / sqrt(a¬≤ + b¬≤).   Let me rewrite the equation of line AB in standard form:   y = m x + 1 => m x - y + 1 = 0   So, a = m, b = -1, c = 1.   So, the distance D from Q(m/2, -1) to AB is:   |m*(m/2) + (-1)*(-1) + 1| / sqrt(m¬≤ + 1)   Let me compute the numerator:   m*(m/2) = m¬≤/2   (-1)*(-1) = 1   So, adding them and the constant term: m¬≤/2 + 1 + 1 = m¬≤/2 + 2   So, numerator is |m¬≤/2 + 2|   Since m¬≤/2 + 2 is always positive, the absolute value is just m¬≤/2 + 2.   Denominator is sqrt(m¬≤ + 1)   So, D = (m¬≤/2 + 2) / sqrt(m¬≤ + 1)10. **Simplify D:** Let me write D as a function of m:    D(m) = (m¬≤/2 + 2) / sqrt(m¬≤ + 1)    We need to find the minimum value of D(m) with respect to m.11. **To find the minimum, take derivative of D with respect to m and set to zero:**    Let me denote D(m) = (m¬≤/2 + 2)(m¬≤ + 1)^(-1/2)    Let's compute D'(m):    Using the product rule:    D'(m) = d/dm [ (m¬≤/2 + 2) ] * (m¬≤ + 1)^(-1/2) + (m¬≤/2 + 2) * d/dm [ (m¬≤ + 1)^(-1/2) ]    Compute each part:    - d/dm [ (m¬≤/2 + 2) ] = m    - d/dm [ (m¬≤ + 1)^(-1/2) ] = (-1/2)(m¬≤ + 1)^(-3/2) * 2m = -m (m¬≤ + 1)^(-3/2)    So, putting it together:    D'(m) = m * (m¬≤ + 1)^(-1/2) + (m¬≤/2 + 2) * (-m)(m¬≤ + 1)^(-3/2)    Let's factor out m (m¬≤ + 1)^(-3/2):    D'(m) = m (m¬≤ + 1)^(-3/2) [ (m¬≤ + 1) - (m¬≤/2 + 2) ]    Simplify the bracket:    (m¬≤ + 1) - (m¬≤/2 + 2) = m¬≤ + 1 - m¬≤/2 - 2 = (m¬≤ - m¬≤/2) + (1 - 2) = (m¬≤/2) - 1    So, D'(m) = m (m¬≤ + 1)^(-3/2) (m¬≤/2 - 1)    Set D'(m) = 0:    So, m (m¬≤/2 - 1) = 0    Solutions:    - m = 0    - m¬≤/2 - 1 = 0 => m¬≤ = 2 => m = sqrt(2) or m = -sqrt(2)12. **Analyze critical points:**    - m = 0: Let's compute D(0):      D(0) = (0 + 2)/sqrt(0 + 1) = 2/1 = 2    - m = sqrt(2):      Compute D(sqrt(2)):      D = ( ( (sqrt(2))¬≤ / 2 + 2 ) / sqrt( (sqrt(2))¬≤ + 1 )      Simplify:      (2/2 + 2) / sqrt(2 + 1) = (1 + 2)/sqrt(3) = 3/sqrt(3) = sqrt(3)    Similarly, for m = -sqrt(2):      Since D(m) depends on m¬≤, it will be the same as for m = sqrt(2). So, D(-sqrt(2)) = sqrt(3)13. **Determine which critical point gives the minimum:**    We have D(0) = 2 and D(¬±sqrt(2)) = sqrt(3) ‚âà 1.732. Since sqrt(3) < 2, the minimum occurs at m = ¬±sqrt(2).14. **Therefore, the minimum distance is sqrt(3).**    But wait, let me double-check my calculations.    When m = sqrt(2):    D(m) = ( ( (sqrt(2))¬≤ / 2 + 2 ) / sqrt( (sqrt(2))¬≤ + 1 ) = ( (2/2 + 2) / sqrt(2 + 1) ) = (1 + 2)/sqrt(3) = 3/sqrt(3) = sqrt(3). Yep, that's correct.    And when m = 0, D(0) = 2, which is larger. So, indeed, the minimum distance is sqrt(3).15. **Wait, but the problem says \\"the minimum distance from point Q to the line AB.\\" So, is sqrt(3) the minimal value?**    Let me think if there's any other critical points or if I missed something.    The derivative D'(m) was set to zero, giving m = 0 and m = ¬±sqrt(2). We evaluated D at these points and found that sqrt(3) is smaller than 2, so that's the minimum.    Also, as m approaches infinity, let's see what happens to D(m):    D(m) = (m¬≤/2 + 2)/sqrt(m¬≤ + 1) ‚âà (m¬≤/2)/|m| = |m|/2, which goes to infinity. So, D(m) tends to infinity as |m| increases, so the minimal value is indeed at m = ¬±sqrt(2).16. **Conclusion:** The minimal distance is sqrt(3).But wait, hold on. Let me think again about point Q. Earlier, I found that Q is (m/2, -1). So, regardless of m, Q is always on the line y = -1. So, the distance from Q to AB is the distance from (m/2, -1) to the line y = m x + 1.But perhaps there's another way to see this. Since Q is fixed at y = -1, and AB is a line with slope m passing through (0,1). So, the distance from Q to AB is the vertical distance from y = -1 to the line AB, but not exactly, because AB is not horizontal.Wait, no, the distance from a point to a line is not necessarily vertical. It's the shortest distance, which is along the perpendicular.But in this case, since Q is on y = -1, maybe we can find the minimal distance by considering the position of Q relative to AB.Alternatively, perhaps using coordinate geometry, we can parametrize everything in terms of m and find the minimal distance.But I think my earlier approach is correct. Let me recap:- Found the equation of AB: y = m x + 1- Found Q as (m/2, -1)- Calculated the distance from Q to AB, got D(m) = (m¬≤/2 + 2)/sqrt(m¬≤ + 1)- Took derivative, found critical points at m = 0 and m = ¬±sqrt(2)- Evaluated D(m) at these points, found that D(sqrt(2)) = sqrt(3) is the minimum.So, unless I made a mistake in the derivative or in simplifying, which I don't see, the minimal distance should be sqrt(3).But wait, let me double-check the distance formula.The distance from (x‚ÇÄ, y‚ÇÄ) to a x + b y + c = 0 is |a x‚ÇÄ + b y‚ÇÄ + c| / sqrt(a¬≤ + b¬≤).In our case, AB is y = m x + 1, which can be written as m x - y + 1 = 0.So, a = m, b = -1, c = 1.Point Q is (m/2, -1).So, plug into the formula:|m*(m/2) + (-1)*(-1) + 1| / sqrt(m¬≤ + 1)Compute numerator:m*(m/2) = m¬≤/2(-1)*(-1) = 1So, total numerator: m¬≤/2 + 1 + 1 = m¬≤/2 + 2Which is correct.So, numerator is |m¬≤/2 + 2|, which is m¬≤/2 + 2 since it's always positive.Denominator is sqrt(m¬≤ + 1)So, D(m) = (m¬≤/2 + 2)/sqrt(m¬≤ + 1)Yes, that's correct.Then, taking derivative:D'(m) = [ (2m)/2 * sqrt(m¬≤ + 1) - (m¬≤/2 + 2)*( (2m)/(2 sqrt(m¬≤ + 1)) ) ] / (m¬≤ + 1)Wait, actually, perhaps I should use quotient rule instead of product rule to compute D'(m).Let me try that.Let me write D(m) = (m¬≤/2 + 2) / (m¬≤ + 1)^(1/2)So, D(m) = numerator / denominator, where numerator = m¬≤/2 + 2, denominator = (m¬≤ + 1)^(1/2)Then, D'(m) = [num‚Äô * den - num * den‚Äô] / den¬≤Compute num‚Äô = d/dm (m¬≤/2 + 2) = mCompute den = (m¬≤ + 1)^(1/2), so den‚Äô = (1/2)(m¬≤ + 1)^(-1/2) * 2m = m / (m¬≤ + 1)^(1/2)So, D'(m) = [m * (m¬≤ + 1)^(1/2) - (m¬≤/2 + 2) * (m / (m¬≤ + 1)^(1/2)) ] / (m¬≤ + 1)Multiply numerator and denominator by (m¬≤ + 1)^(1/2) to simplify:Numerator becomes:m (m¬≤ + 1) - (m¬≤/2 + 2) mDenominator becomes:(m¬≤ + 1)^(3/2)So, numerator:m (m¬≤ + 1 - m¬≤/2 - 2) = m ( (m¬≤ - m¬≤/2) + (1 - 2) ) = m (m¬≤/2 - 1)So, D'(m) = [m (m¬≤/2 - 1)] / (m¬≤ + 1)^(3/2)Set D'(m) = 0:m (m¬≤/2 - 1) = 0Solutions: m = 0 or m¬≤/2 - 1 = 0 => m¬≤ = 2 => m = ¬±sqrt(2)Same as before.So, that confirms the critical points.Therefore, the minimal distance is sqrt(3).Wait, but just to make sure, let me compute D(m) at m = sqrt(2):D(sqrt(2)) = ( ( (sqrt(2))¬≤ / 2 + 2 ) / sqrt( (sqrt(2))¬≤ + 1 ) = ( (2/2 + 2 ) / sqrt(2 + 1 ) = (1 + 2)/sqrt(3) = 3 / sqrt(3) = sqrt(3)Yes, that's correct.Similarly, at m = 0, D(0) = (0 + 2)/sqrt(0 + 1) = 2/1 = 2.Therefore, the minimal distance is sqrt(3).So, the answer is sqrt(3), which is approximately 1.732.But let me think again: is there a way to see this without calculus? Maybe using geometry or properties of parabolas.I know that for a parabola, the tangent lines at two points intersect at the point called the \\"exterior point\\" or something like that. But I'm not sure if that helps here.Alternatively, maybe using reflection properties. But I think the calculus approach is solid here.Alternatively, perhaps parametrize the line AB differently.Wait, another approach: Let me consider the parametric equations.Let me denote the line AB as passing through P(0,1) with slope m, so equation y = m x + 1.It intersects the parabola y = x¬≤ at points A and B, which we found as x = [m ¬± sqrt(m¬≤ + 4)] / 2.Then, the tangent lines at A and B intersect at Q(m/2, -1). So, Q is fixed at y = -1, x = m/2.So, as m varies, Q moves along the line y = -1.We need the minimal distance from Q to AB.But AB is the line y = m x + 1, which is variable depending on m.So, as m changes, both the line AB and the position of Q change.We need to find the minimal distance between Q(m/2, -1) and AB: y = m x + 1.Which is exactly what I computed earlier, leading to D(m) = (m¬≤/2 + 2)/sqrt(m¬≤ + 1), which has a minimal value of sqrt(3).Therefore, I think the minimal distance is sqrt(3).**Final Answer**The minimum distance from point ( Q ) to the line ( AB ) is (boxed{sqrt{3}})."},{"question":"1. In \\"One Thousand and One Nights,\\" there is a passage: There is a group of pigeons, some of which are singing in the tree, and others are looking for food on the ground. A pigeon in the tree said to the pigeons looking for food on the ground: \\"If one more pigeon from you flies up, then the pigeons on the ground will be one-sixth of the total number of pigeons. If one pigeon from us flies down, then the number of pigeons in the tree and on the ground will be the same.\\" Do you know how many pigeons there are in total?2. The sum of the ages of Xiaoliang and his father and grandfather is 120 years. The age of the grandfather is 12 years more than the sum of the ages of Xiaoliang and his father. The difference in age between the father and Xiaoliang is exactly the same as the difference in age between the grandfather and the father. What are their respective ages?","answer":"Okay, so I have two math problems here, both from \\"One Thousand and One Nights.\\" Let me try to figure them out one by one.Starting with the first problem about the pigeons. There's a group of pigeons, some in a tree singing and others on the ground looking for food. A pigeon in the tree makes two statements:1. If one more pigeon flies up from the ground to the tree, then the pigeons on the ground will be one-sixth of the total number.2. If one pigeon flies down from the tree to the ground, then the number of pigeons in the tree and on the ground will be the same.I need to find the total number of pigeons.Hmm, let's denote the number of pigeons in the tree as T and the number on the ground as G. So the total number of pigeons is T + G.First statement: If one more pigeon flies up, so the number on the ground becomes G - 1, and this will be one-sixth of the total. So, G - 1 = (1/6)(T + G). That seems right.Second statement: If one pigeon flies down, so the number in the tree becomes T - 1, and the number on the ground becomes G + 1. These two will be equal. So, T - 1 = G + 1. That simplifies to T = G + 2.Okay, so now I have two equations:1. G - 1 = (1/6)(T + G)2. T = G + 2Let me substitute equation 2 into equation 1.So, G - 1 = (1/6)( (G + 2) + G )Simplify the right side: (1/6)(2G + 2) = (2G + 2)/6 = (G + 1)/3So, equation becomes: G - 1 = (G + 1)/3Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the denominator:3(G - 1) = G + 13G - 3 = G + 1Subtract G from both sides:2G - 3 = 1Add 3 to both sides:2G = 4Divide by 2:G = 2Wait, so G is 2? Then from equation 2, T = G + 2 = 4.So total pigeons are T + G = 4 + 2 = 6.But let me check if this makes sense.First condition: If one more pigeon flies up, so ground pigeons become 1. Total is 6, so 1 should be 1/6 of 6, which is 1. That works.Second condition: If one pigeon flies down, tree pigeons become 3 and ground pigeons become 3. So they are equal. That also works.Wait, but 6 pigeons seems a bit low. Let me see if I made a mistake.Wait, when I substituted, I had G - 1 = (G + 1)/3. Let me check that step again.Original equation: G - 1 = (1/6)(T + G)But T = G + 2, so substituting:G - 1 = (1/6)(G + 2 + G) = (1/6)(2G + 2) = (2G + 2)/6 = (G + 1)/3Yes, that's correct.Then 3(G - 1) = G + 13G - 3 = G + 12G = 4G = 2So, seems correct. So total is 6.Hmm, maybe it's correct. Maybe the numbers are small.Alright, moving on to the second problem.The sum of the ages of Xiaoliang and his father and grandfather is 120 years.So, let me denote:Let X be Xiaoliang's age,F be father's age,G be grandfather's age.So, X + F + G = 120.Second statement: The grandfather's age is 12 years more than the sum of the ages of Xiaoliang and his father.So, G = (X + F) + 12.Third statement: The difference in age between the father and Xiaoliang is exactly the same as the difference in age between the grandfather and the father.So, |F - X| = |G - F|Assuming all ages are positive, and grandfather is older than father, and father is older than Xiaoliang, so G > F > X.Therefore, G - F = F - X.So, G - F = F - XWhich can be rewritten as G + X = 2F.So, G = 2F - X.Alright, so now we have:1. X + F + G = 1202. G = X + F + 123. G = 2F - XSo, let's substitute equation 2 into equation 1.From equation 2: G = X + F + 12Substitute into equation 1:X + F + (X + F + 12) = 120Simplify:2X + 2F + 12 = 120Divide both sides by 2:X + F + 6 = 60So, X + F = 54But from equation 2, G = 54 + 12 = 66So, G = 66Now, from equation 3: G = 2F - XWe know G = 66, so:66 = 2F - XBut from X + F = 54, we can express X = 54 - FSubstitute into equation 3:66 = 2F - (54 - F)Simplify:66 = 2F - 54 + F66 = 3F - 54Add 54 to both sides:120 = 3FDivide by 3:F = 40So, father is 40.Then, X = 54 - F = 54 - 40 = 14So, Xiaoliang is 14, father is 40, grandfather is 66.Let me check the conditions.Sum: 14 + 40 + 66 = 120. Correct.Grandfather's age: 66. Sum of Xiaoliang and father: 14 + 40 = 54. 54 + 12 = 66. Correct.Difference between father and Xiaoliang: 40 - 14 = 26. Difference between grandfather and father: 66 - 40 = 26. Correct.So, that seems to check out.So, Xiaoliang is 14, father is 40, grandfather is 66.**Final Answer**1. The total number of pigeons is boxed{6}.2.

In base-( k ), the rightmost digit represents the units place (( k^0 )) and the next digit represents the ( k^1 ) place.Next, I'll express the base-( k ) number 32 in its decimal equivalent. This means calculating ( 3 times k^1 + 2 times k^0 ), which simplifies to ( 3k + 2 ).According to the problem, this decimal value is equal to 26. So, I'll set up the equation ( 3k + 2 = 26 ).To solve for ( k ), I'll subtract 2 from both sides of the equation, resulting in ( 3k = 24 ). Then, I'll divide both sides by 3 to find that ( k = 8 ).Finally, I'll verify the solution by converting the base-8 number 32 back to decimal.

Let me verify.I remember that the formula for the sum of consecutive integers from a to b is given by (b(b+1)/2) - ((a-1)a/2), which simplifies to (b - a + 1)(a + b)/2. So, if we let n be the number of terms, and m be the average of the first and last term, then the sum is n*m. Therefore, for a number to be expressible as such a sum, it must be able to be factored into n and m, where n is at least 2, and m is the average of the first and last term.But wait, m has to be a positive integer because the average of two integers is either an integer or a half-integer. However, since the sum is an integer, m must be either an integer or a half-integer. But in the case of consecutive integers, if n is odd, m will be an integer, and if n is even, m will be a half-integer. So, in either case, the number can be expressed as such a sum if it has an odd factor greater than 1.Hmm, so if a number is a power of 2, it doesn't have any odd factors except 1. Therefore, it cannot be expressed as the sum of two or more consecutive positive integers. That seems to align with what I thought earlier.So, the key here is to determine which of these numbers are powers of 2 because those cannot be expressed as the sum of consecutive integers. Let me check each number:1. 101: Is 101 a power of 2? Let's see. 2^6 is 64, 2^7 is 128. So, 101 is between 64 and 128, but it's not a power of 2. So, 101 can be expressed as such a sum.2. 148: Is 148 a power of 2? 2^7 is 128, 2^8 is 256. 148 is in between, but not a power of 2. So, 148 can be expressed as such a sum.3. 200: Similarly, 2^7 is 128, 2^8 is 256. 200 is in between, not a power of 2. So, 200 can be expressed.4. 512: Hmm, 512 is 2^9. So, that's a power of 2. Therefore, 512 cannot be expressed as the sum of two or more consecutive positive integers.5. 621: Let's see. 2^9 is 512, 2^10 is 1024. 621 is in between, not a power of 2. So, 621 can be expressed.So, out of the five numbers, only 512 is a power of 2. Therefore, only one number cannot be expressed as the sum of two or more consecutive positive integers.Wait, hold on. Let me double-check. Is 512 indeed a power of 2? Yes, 2^9 is 512. So, that's correct. The others are not powers of 2, so they can be expressed as such sums.But just to be thorough, let me try to express one of them as a sum of consecutive integers to make sure. Let's take 101.To express 101 as the sum of consecutive integers, we can use the formula I mentioned earlier. Let me denote the number of terms as n and the starting integer as a. Then, the sum is n*(2a + n - 1)/2 = 101. So, 2*101 = n*(2a + n - 1). Therefore, 202 = n*(2a + n - 1). So, n must be a factor of 202.Factors of 202 are 1, 2, 101, 202. Since n must be at least 2, possible n values are 2, 101, 202. Let's try n=2: Then, 202 = 2*(2a + 2 - 1) => 202 = 2*(2a +1) => 101 = 2a +1 => 2a=100 => a=50. So, 50 + 51 = 101. That works. So, 101 can indeed be expressed as the sum of two consecutive integers.Similarly, let's check 148. Let's see if it can be expressed as a sum of consecutive integers. Using the same formula: 2*148 = n*(2a + n -1) => 296 = n*(2a + n -1). So, n must be a factor of 296. The factors of 296 are 1, 2, 4, 8, 37, 74, 148, 296. Let's try n=4: 296 = 4*(2a +4 -1) => 296 = 4*(2a +3) => 74 = 2a +3 => 2a=71 => a=35.5. Hmm, not an integer. Let's try n=8: 296=8*(2a +8 -1) => 296=8*(2a +7) => 37=2a +7 => 2a=30 => a=15. So, starting at 15, 8 consecutive numbers: 15+16+17+18+19+20+21+22. Let me add them up: 15+22=37, 16+21=37, 17+20=37, 18+19=37. So, 4 pairs of 37, which is 4*37=148. Perfect, that works. So, 148 can be expressed as such a sum.How about 200? Let's try n=5: 2*200=400=5*(2a +5 -1)=5*(2a +4). So, 400=5*(2a +4) => 80=2a +4 => 2a=76 => a=38. So, starting at 38, 5 numbers: 38+39+40+41+42. Let's add them: 38+42=80, 39+41=80, and 40 is 40. So, total is 80+80+40=200. Perfect, that works.512 is a power of 2, so as per the earlier reasoning, it cannot be expressed as such a sum. Let me just confirm that. If I try to express 512 as a sum of consecutive integers, let's see. 2*512=1024. So, n*(2a +n -1)=1024. So, n must be a factor of 1024. But 1024 is 2^10, so all its factors are powers of 2. So, n=2,4,8,16,... Let's try n=2: 1024=2*(2a +2 -1)=2*(2a +1) => 512=2a +1 => 2a=511 => a=255.5. Not an integer. Next, n=4: 1024=4*(2a +4 -1)=4*(2a +3) => 256=2a +3 => 2a=253 => a=126.5. Not integer. Next, n=8: 1024=8*(2a +8 -1)=8*(2a +7) => 128=2a +7 => 2a=121 => a=60.5. Not integer. Similarly, n=16: 1024=16*(2a +16 -1)=16*(2a +15) => 64=2a +15 => 2a=49 => a=24.5. Not integer. So, it seems for all n that are powers of 2, a is not an integer. Therefore, 512 cannot be expressed as the sum of two or more consecutive positive integers.Lastly, 621. Let's see if it can be expressed. 2*621=1242. So, n*(2a +n -1)=1242. Let's find factors of 1242. 1242 divided by 2 is 621, which is 3*207, which is 3*3*69, which is 3*3*3*23. So, factors are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 23, 27, 46, 54, 69, 138, 207, 387, 621, 1242. Let's try n=3: 1242=3*(2a +3 -1)=3*(2a +2) => 414=2a +2 => 2a=412 => a=206. So, starting at 206, three numbers: 206+207+208. Let's add them: 206+208=414, plus 207 is 621. Perfect, that works.So, all numbers except 512 can be expressed as the sum of two or more consecutive positive integers. Therefore, only one number cannot be expressed that way.Wait, but hold on. I just want to make sure I didn't miss anything. Is there another way that a number which is a power of 2 can be expressed as a sum of consecutive integers? Maybe in a different way? Let me think.Suppose I try to express 512 as a sum of more than two numbers. Let's say n=5: 2*512=1024=5*(2a +5 -1)=5*(2a +4). So, 1024=5*(2a +4) => 204.8=2a +4. Hmm, not an integer. Similarly, n=3: 1024=3*(2a +3 -1)=3*(2a +2) => 341.333=2a +2. Not integer. So, no, it doesn't seem possible.Alternatively, maybe negative integers? But the problem specifies positive integers, so that's not allowed. So, yeah, 512 cannot be expressed as such.Therefore, the answer is 1, which is option B.**Final Answer**boxed{B}"},{"question":"Solve the equation ( x^{2}-x y-6 y^{2}+2 x+19 y=18 ) in integers.","answer":"Alright, so I have this equation to solve: ( x^{2} - x y - 6 y^{2} + 2 x + 19 y = 18 ). Hmm, it's a quadratic in both x and y, and I need to find integer solutions. I remember that sometimes with these kinds of equations, it's helpful to rearrange terms or complete the square to make it easier to factor or analyze.Let me write down the equation again:( x^{2} - x y - 6 y^{2} + 2 x + 19 y = 18 )I notice that there are terms with x squared, xy, and y squared, so maybe I can treat this as a quadratic in x and try to solve for x in terms of y. That might help me find integer solutions because if I can express x as a function of y, I can then look for integer y that makes x also an integer.So, let's rearrange the equation to group the x terms together:( x^{2} + (-y + 2) x + (-6 y^{2} + 19 y - 18) = 0 )Yes, that looks like a quadratic in x: ( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 ), where:- ( a = 1 )- ( b = (-y + 2) )- ( c = (-6 y^{2} + 19 y - 18) )For this quadratic equation to have integer solutions, the discriminant must be a perfect square. The discriminant D is given by ( D = b^2 - 4ac ).Let me compute D:( D = (-y + 2)^2 - 4 * 1 * (-6 y^{2} + 19 y - 18) )First, expand ( (-y + 2)^2 ):( (-y + 2)^2 = y^2 - 4 y + 4 )Now, compute ( -4ac ):( -4 * 1 * (-6 y^{2} + 19 y - 18) = 24 y^{2} - 76 y + 72 )So, adding these together for D:( D = (y^2 - 4 y + 4) + (24 y^{2} - 76 y + 72) )Combine like terms:- ( y^2 + 24 y^2 = 25 y^2 )- ( -4 y - 76 y = -80 y )- ( 4 + 72 = 76 )So, ( D = 25 y^2 - 80 y + 76 )Hmm, so the discriminant is ( 25 y^2 - 80 y + 76 ). For x to be an integer, this discriminant must be a perfect square. Let me denote ( D = k^2 ), where k is an integer.Therefore, we have:( 25 y^2 - 80 y + 76 = k^2 )This is a Diophantine equation in y and k. Let me try to solve this equation for integers y and k.First, perhaps I can complete the square for the quadratic in y.Let me factor out the coefficient of y^2:( 25(y^2 - (80/25)y) + 76 = k^2 )Simplify 80/25 to 16/5:( 25(y^2 - (16/5)y) + 76 = k^2 )Now, to complete the square inside the parentheses:Take half of 16/5, which is 8/5, and square it: (8/5)^2 = 64/25.So, add and subtract 64/25 inside the parentheses:( 25left( y^2 - frac{16}{5} y + frac{64}{25} - frac{64}{25} right) + 76 = k^2 )Simplify:( 25left( left( y - frac{8}{5} right)^2 - frac{64}{25} right) + 76 = k^2 )Distribute the 25:( 25left( y - frac{8}{5} right)^2 - 25 * frac{64}{25} + 76 = k^2 )Simplify:( 25left( y - frac{8}{5} right)^2 - 64 + 76 = k^2 )Which becomes:( 25left( y - frac{8}{5} right)^2 + 12 = k^2 )Hmm, so:( 25left( y - frac{8}{5} right)^2 = k^2 - 12 )But since y is an integer, ( y - frac{8}{5} ) is not necessarily an integer. Maybe I can make a substitution to make this expression cleaner.Let me set ( z = 5y - 8 ). Then, ( y = frac{z + 8}{5} ). Since y is an integer, z must be congruent to 2 mod 5, because ( z + 8 ) must be divisible by 5. So, z ‚â° 2 mod 5.Let me substitute z into the equation:First, compute ( 25left( y - frac{8}{5} right)^2 ):( 25left( frac{z + 8}{5} - frac{8}{5} right)^2 = 25left( frac{z}{5} right)^2 = 25 * frac{z^2}{25} = z^2 )So, substituting back into the equation:( z^2 = k^2 - 12 )Which rearranges to:( k^2 - z^2 = 12 )This is a difference of squares, so it factors as:( (k - z)(k + z) = 12 )Now, since k and z are integers, and k > z (since k^2 > z^2 because 12 is positive), we can find all pairs of integers (d, e) such that d * e = 12, and e > d, and then solve for k and z.So, the factor pairs of 12 are:1. (1, 12)2. (2, 6)3. (3, 4)Also, considering negative factors:4. (-1, -12)5. (-2, -6)6. (-3, -4)But since e > d, we can consider both positive and negative pairs.Let me go through each factor pair:**Case 1: d = 1, e = 12**So,( k - z = 1 )( k + z = 12 )Adding both equations:( 2k = 13 implies k = 13/2 )But k must be integer, so discard this case.**Case 2: d = 2, e = 6**( k - z = 2 )( k + z = 6 )Adding:( 2k = 8 implies k = 4 )Subtracting:( 2z = 6 - 2 = 4 implies z = 2 )So, z = 2, k = 4.**Case 3: d = 3, e = 4**( k - z = 3 )( k + z = 4 )Adding:( 2k = 7 implies k = 7/2 )Not integer, discard.**Case 4: d = -1, e = -12**( k - z = -1 )( k + z = -12 )Adding:( 2k = -13 implies k = -13/2 )Not integer, discard.**Case 5: d = -2, e = -6**( k - z = -2 )( k + z = -6 )Adding:( 2k = -8 implies k = -4 )Subtracting:( 2z = -6 - (-2) = -4 implies z = -2 )So, z = -2, k = -4.**Case 6: d = -3, e = -4**( k - z = -3 )( k + z = -4 )Adding:( 2k = -7 implies k = -7/2 )Not integer, discard.So, the only valid cases are Case 2 and Case 5, giving us (z, k) = (2, 4) and (-2, -4).Now, recall that z = 5y - 8.So, for z = 2:( 5y - 8 = 2 implies 5y = 10 implies y = 2 )For z = -2:( 5y - 8 = -2 implies 5y = 6 implies y = 6/5 )But y must be integer, so y = 6/5 is invalid. So, only y = 2 is valid.Wait, hold on, z = -2 gives y = 6/5, which is not integer, so we discard that.So, only y = 2 is a solution.Wait, but let me check if I missed any factor pairs.Wait, 12 can also be factored as (4, 3), but since we already considered (3,4) and it didn't yield integer solutions, same with others.So, only y = 2 is possible.But let me verify this because sometimes when dealing with quadratics, especially when completing the square, sometimes substitutions can lead to missing solutions.Wait, let's check if y = 2 is indeed a solution.So, plug y = 2 into the original equation:( x^{2} - x*2 - 6*(2)^2 + 2x + 19*2 = 18 )Compute each term:- ( x^2 )- ( -2x )- ( -6*4 = -24 )- ( +2x )- ( +38 )So, combine like terms:( x^2 -2x + 2x -24 + 38 = x^2 + 14 = 18 )So, ( x^2 + 14 = 18 implies x^2 = 4 implies x = pm 2 )So, x can be 2 or -2.Therefore, when y = 2, x can be 2 or -2.So, solutions are (2, 2) and (-2, 2).Wait, but earlier when I solved for z, I only got y = 2 as a solution, but let me check if there are other possible y.Wait, perhaps I missed some factor pairs?Wait, 12 can also be factored as ( -4, -3 ), but I think I considered all factor pairs where d <= e.Wait, let me think again.Wait, in the equation ( (k - z)(k + z) = 12 ), the factor pairs can be positive and negative, but I considered all possible pairs where d and e have the same sign because if d and e have opposite signs, their product would be negative, but 12 is positive, so both factors must be positive or both negative.Thus, I think I considered all possible factor pairs.But just to be thorough, let me check if y can take other integer values.Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution.Wait, when I set z = 5y - 8, then y = (z + 8)/5, which must be integer, so z must be congruent to 2 mod 5, as I thought earlier.But in the solutions, z was 2 and -2, which are both congruent to 2 mod 5? Wait, 2 mod 5 is 2, and -2 mod 5 is 3, right? Because -2 + 5 = 3.Wait, so z = 2 is 2 mod 5, which is acceptable, but z = -2 is 3 mod 5, which is not 2 mod 5. So, perhaps z = -2 is not acceptable because y must be integer.Wait, but earlier, when z = -2, y = ( -2 + 8 ) /5 = 6/5, which is not integer, so indeed, z must be 2 mod 5.Therefore, only z = 2 is acceptable, leading to y = 2.So, only y = 2 is a solution, leading to x = 2 and x = -2.Wait, but let me check if there are other possible y.Wait, perhaps I can try plugging in small integer values for y and see if x comes out integer.Let me try y = 1:Plug y = 1 into the original equation:( x^2 - x*1 -6*1 + 2x +19*1 = 18 )Simplify:( x^2 -x -6 + 2x +19 = x^2 + x +13 = 18 )So, ( x^2 + x +13 = 18 implies x^2 + x -5 = 0 )Discriminant: 1 + 20 = 21, which is not a perfect square, so no integer solutions.y = 0:( x^2 -0 -0 +2x +0 = 18 implies x^2 + 2x -18 = 0 )Discriminant: 4 + 72 = 76, not a perfect square.y = 3:( x^2 -3x -6*9 +2x +19*3 = x^2 -3x -54 +2x +57 = x^2 -x +3 = 18 )So, ( x^2 -x +3 = 18 implies x^2 -x -15 = 0 )Discriminant: 1 + 60 = 61, not a perfect square.y = 4:( x^2 -4x -6*16 +2x +19*4 = x^2 -4x -96 +2x +76 = x^2 -2x -20 = 18 )So, ( x^2 -2x -20 = 18 implies x^2 -2x -38 = 0 )Discriminant: 4 + 152 = 156, not a perfect square.y = 5:( x^2 -5x -6*25 +2x +19*5 = x^2 -5x -150 +2x +95 = x^2 -3x -55 = 18 )So, ( x^2 -3x -55 = 18 implies x^2 -3x -73 = 0 )Discriminant: 9 + 292 = 301, not a perfect square.y = -1:( x^2 -(-1)x -6*1 +2x +19*(-1) = x^2 +x -6 +2x -19 = x^2 +3x -25 = 18 )So, ( x^2 +3x -25 = 18 implies x^2 +3x -43 = 0 )Discriminant: 9 + 172 = 181, not a perfect square.y = -2:( x^2 -(-2)x -6*4 +2x +19*(-2) = x^2 +2x -24 +2x -38 = x^2 +4x -62 = 18 )So, ( x^2 +4x -62 = 18 implies x^2 +4x -80 = 0 )Discriminant: 16 + 320 = 336, not a perfect square.y = -3:( x^2 -(-3)x -6*9 +2x +19*(-3) = x^2 +3x -54 +2x -57 = x^2 +5x -111 = 18 )So, ( x^2 +5x -111 = 18 implies x^2 +5x -129 = 0 )Discriminant: 25 + 516 = 541, not a perfect square.Hmm, so it seems like y = 2 is the only integer value that gives integer x.Wait, but earlier when I solved for z, I only got y = 2 as a solution, so perhaps that's the only solution.But let me check y = 2 again.When y = 2, x^2 -2x -24 +2x +38 = x^2 +14 = 18, so x^2 = 4, x = ¬±2.So, solutions are (2, 2) and (-2, 2).Wait, but let me check if these are the only solutions.Wait, perhaps I can try another approach.Looking back at the original equation:( x^{2} - x y -6 y^{2} + 2 x +19 y = 18 )I can try to rearrange terms to group x and y terms.Let me group x terms and y terms:( x^2 + (-y + 2)x + (-6 y^2 +19 y -18) = 0 )Wait, that's the same as before.Alternatively, maybe I can factor the quadratic in x.But since the discriminant led me to only y = 2, perhaps that's the only solution.Wait, but let me try to factor the quadratic in x.Looking at ( x^2 + (-y + 2)x + (-6 y^2 +19 y -18) ), perhaps it can be factored as (x + a y + b)(x + c y + d).Let me attempt to factor it.Assume:( (x + a y + b)(x + c y + d) = x^2 + (a + c)y x + (ac y^2 + (ad + bc)y + bd) )Compare to original:( x^2 + (-y + 2)x + (-6 y^2 +19 y -18) )So, equate coefficients:1. Coefficient of x^2: 1 = 1, okay.2. Coefficient of x y: a + c = -13. Coefficient of y^2: a c = -64. Coefficient of y: a d + b c = 195. Constant term: b d = -18So, we have a system:a + c = -1a c = -6a d + b c = 19b d = -18We need to find integers a, c, b, d satisfying these.First, solve a + c = -1 and a c = -6.Find integers a and c such that a + c = -1 and a c = -6.Possible pairs (a, c):Looking for two numbers that add to -1 and multiply to -6.Possible pairs:- (2, -3): 2 + (-3) = -1, 2*(-3) = -6. Yes, that works.- (-2, 3): -2 + 3 = 1 ‚â† -1, so no.- (3, -2): 3 + (-2) = 1 ‚â† -1.- (-3, 2): -3 + 2 = -1, and (-3)*2 = -6. That also works.So, possible (a, c) pairs are (2, -3) and (-3, 2).Let me take (a, c) = (2, -3) first.Then, we have:a = 2, c = -3.Now, from a d + b c = 19:2 d + b*(-3) = 19Which is 2d - 3b = 19.And from b d = -18.So, we have:2d - 3b = 19b d = -18We need to find integers b and d satisfying these.Let me list the factor pairs of -18:(1, -18), (-1, 18), (2, -9), (-2, 9), (3, -6), (-3, 6)Let me test each pair:1. b = 1, d = -18:Plug into 2d - 3b = 2*(-18) - 3*1 = -36 -3 = -39 ‚â† 192. b = -1, d = 18:2*18 -3*(-1) = 36 +3 = 39 ‚â†193. b = 2, d = -9:2*(-9) -3*2 = -18 -6 = -24 ‚â†194. b = -2, d =9:2*9 -3*(-2) = 18 +6 =24 ‚â†195. b =3, d=-6:2*(-6) -3*3 = -12 -9 =-21‚â†196. b=-3, d=6:2*6 -3*(-3)=12 +9=21‚â†19Hmm, none of these work. So, perhaps (a, c) = (2, -3) doesn't lead to a solution.Now, try (a, c) = (-3, 2).So, a = -3, c = 2.Then, from a d + b c = 19:-3 d + b*2 = 19Which is -3d + 2b =19And from b d = -18.So, again, list the factor pairs of -18:(1, -18), (-1, 18), (2, -9), (-2, 9), (3, -6), (-3, 6)Test each pair:1. b =1, d=-18:-3*(-18) + 2*1 =54 +2=56‚â†192. b=-1, d=18:-3*18 +2*(-1)= -54 -2=-56‚â†193. b=2, d=-9:-3*(-9) +2*2=27 +4=31‚â†194. b=-2, d=9:-3*9 +2*(-2)= -27 -4=-31‚â†195. b=3, d=-6:-3*(-6) +2*3=18 +6=24‚â†196. b=-3, d=6:-3*6 +2*(-3)= -18 -6=-24‚â†19Hmm, none of these work either.So, it seems that the quadratic doesn't factor nicely with integer coefficients, which suggests that perhaps y = 2 is indeed the only solution.Wait, but earlier when I solved for z, I only got y = 2 as a valid solution, so maybe that's the only one.Therefore, the integer solutions are (2, 2) and (-2, 2).But let me just check if there are other possible y values that I might have missed.Wait, perhaps I can consider that when I set z =5y -8, and found z =2, leading to y=2, but maybe there are other z values that could lead to y being integer.Wait, but in the equation ( k^2 - z^2 =12 ), we found only two factor pairs that gave integer solutions, leading to z=2 and z=-2, but z=-2 didn't give integer y.So, perhaps y=2 is the only solution.Therefore, the integer solutions are (2,2) and (-2,2).Wait, but let me check if x can take other values when y=2.Wait, when y=2, the equation becomes x¬≤ +14=18, so x¬≤=4, so x=¬±2, which are integers.So, yes, those are the only solutions.Therefore, the integer solutions are (2,2) and (-2,2).**Final Answer**The integer solutions are (boxed{(2, 2)}) and (boxed{(-2, 2)})."},{"question":"In the diagram, every number beginning at 30 equals twice the sum of the two numbers to its immediate left.

It is known that (angle LKC = 45^circ), (AK = 1), and (KD = 2). Find (LB).","answer":"Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to visualize it first. There's a square named ABCD. Since it's a square, all sides are equal, and all angles are 90 degrees. Let me label the square: A is the top-left corner, B is the top-right, C is the bottom-right, and D is the bottom-left. So, sides AB, BC, CD, and DA are all equal.Now, on side AD, there's a point K. They tell me that AK is 1 unit and KD is 2 units. Since AD is a side of the square, its total length should be AK + KD, which is 1 + 2 = 3 units. So, each side of the square is 3 units long. That means AB, BC, CD, and DA are all 3 units each.Next, on the extension of the ray AB beyond point B, there's a point L. So, if I imagine the ray starting at A, going through B, and then extending beyond B, L is somewhere on that extension. The problem states that angle LKC is 45 degrees, and we need to find the length LB.Alright, let's try to draw this out mentally. Point K is on AD, closer to A since AK is 1 and KD is 2. Point L is beyond B on the extension of AB. So, triangle LKC is formed by points L, K, and C. The angle at K is 45 degrees.I think coordinate geometry might help here. Let me assign coordinates to each point to make it easier.Let's place the square ABCD on a coordinate plane. Let me set point A at (0, 3), B at (3, 3), C at (3, 0), and D at (0, 0). So, side AD goes from (0, 3) to (0, 0). Point K is on AD, 1 unit from A, so K must be at (0, 3 - 1) = (0, 2). Wait, no. If AK is 1, and AD is 3, then starting from A (0,3), moving down 1 unit along AD, which is the y-axis, so K is at (0, 2). Correct.Point L is on the extension of AB beyond B. AB goes from A(0,3) to B(3,3). Extending beyond B would be along the same horizontal line, so L must be at (3 + x, 3) for some x > 0. So, coordinates of L are (3 + x, 3). We need to find x, which is LB.Wait, actually, LB is the distance from L to B. Since B is at (3,3) and L is at (3 + x, 3), the distance LB is just x units. So, if I can find x, that's the answer.Given that angle LKC is 45 degrees. So, angle at K between points L, K, and C is 45 degrees. Let me write down the coordinates:- K: (0, 2)- C: (3, 0)- L: (3 + x, 3)I can compute the vectors from K to L and from K to C, then use the tangent of the angle between them to set up an equation.First, vector KL: from K(0,2) to L(3 + x, 3). So, the vector is (3 + x - 0, 3 - 2) = (3 + x, 1).Vector KC: from K(0,2) to C(3,0). So, the vector is (3 - 0, 0 - 2) = (3, -2).The angle between vectors KL and KC is 45 degrees. The formula for the tangent of the angle between two vectors u and v is:tan(theta) = |(u x v)| / (u ¬∑ v)Where u x v is the magnitude of the cross product, and u ¬∑ v is the dot product.Given theta is 45 degrees, so tan(theta) = 1.So, |(KL x KC)| / (KL ¬∑ KC) = 1.Let's compute the cross product and dot product.First, cross product in 2D can be represented as the determinant:KL x KC = (3 + x)(-2) - (1)(3) = -2(3 + x) - 3 = -6 - 2x - 3 = -9 - 2xThe magnitude is | -9 - 2x | = |9 + 2x|Dot product KL ¬∑ KC = (3 + x)(3) + (1)(-2) = 9 + 3x - 2 = 7 + 3xSo, according to the formula:|9 + 2x| / (7 + 3x) = 1Which implies:|9 + 2x| = 7 + 3xSince 9 + 2x is positive for x > -4.5, and since x is a length beyond B, x must be positive. So, 9 + 2x is positive, so we can drop the absolute value:9 + 2x = 7 + 3xSolving for x:9 - 7 = 3x - 2x2 = xSo, x = 2.Therefore, LB is 2 units.Wait, let me verify this because sometimes when dealing with angles, especially in coordinate geometry, the direction of vectors can affect the angle. Let me double-check.Alternatively, maybe using slopes would be better. Let me try that approach.Compute the slopes of lines KL and KC.Point K is (0,2), point L is (3 + x, 3), point C is (3,0).Slope of KL: (3 - 2)/(3 + x - 0) = 1/(3 + x)Slope of KC: (0 - 2)/(3 - 0) = (-2)/3The angle between two lines with slopes m1 and m2 is given by:tan(theta) = |(m2 - m1)/(1 + m1*m2)|Given theta is 45 degrees, so tan(theta) = 1.So,|(m2 - m1)/(1 + m1*m2)| = 1Plugging in m1 = 1/(3 + x) and m2 = -2/3:|(-2/3 - 1/(3 + x)) / (1 + (1/(3 + x))*(-2/3))| = 1Let me compute numerator and denominator separately.Numerator:-2/3 - 1/(3 + x) = (-2(3 + x) - 3)/[3(3 + x)] = (-6 - 2x - 3)/[3(3 + x)] = (-9 - 2x)/[3(3 + x)]Denominator:1 + (1/(3 + x))*(-2/3) = 1 - 2/[3(3 + x)] = [3(3 + x) - 2]/[3(3 + x)] = (9 + 3x - 2)/[3(3 + x)] = (7 + 3x)/[3(3 + x)]So, putting them together:| [ (-9 - 2x)/[3(3 + x)] ] / [ (7 + 3x)/[3(3 + x)] ] | = | (-9 - 2x)/(7 + 3x) | = 1Which simplifies to | (-9 - 2x)/(7 + 3x) | = 1Since both numerator and denominator are linear in x, and x is positive, let's see:(-9 - 2x)/(7 + 3x) = ¬±1Case 1: (-9 - 2x)/(7 + 3x) = 1Multiply both sides by (7 + 3x):-9 - 2x = 7 + 3xBring variables to one side:-9 - 7 = 3x + 2x-16 = 5xx = -16/5But x is positive, so discard this solution.Case 2: (-9 - 2x)/(7 + 3x) = -1Multiply both sides by (7 + 3x):-9 - 2x = -7 - 3xBring variables to one side:-9 + 7 = -3x + 2x-2 = -xx = 2Which is positive, so x = 2 is the solution.Therefore, LB is 2 units.Hmm, so both methods gave me the same answer, which is reassuring. So, I think LB is 2.Wait, just to make sure, let me plug x = 2 back into the coordinates and see if angle LKC is indeed 45 degrees.Point L is at (3 + 2, 3) = (5, 3)Point K is at (0, 2)Point C is at (3, 0)So, triangle LKC has points L(5,3), K(0,2), C(3,0)Let me compute vectors KL and KC.Vector KL: from K(0,2) to L(5,3): (5 - 0, 3 - 2) = (5,1)Vector KC: from K(0,2) to C(3,0): (3 - 0, 0 - 2) = (3,-2)Compute the angle between vectors (5,1) and (3,-2).Dot product: 5*3 + 1*(-2) = 15 - 2 = 13Magnitude of KL: sqrt(5^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(25 + 1) = sqrt(26)Magnitude of KC: sqrt(3^2 + (-2)^2) = sqrt(9 + 4) = sqrt(13)So, cos(theta) = dot product / (|KL| |KC|) = 13 / (sqrt(26)*sqrt(13)) = 13 / (sqrt(338)) = 13 / (13*sqrt(2)) ) = 1/sqrt(2)So, theta = 45 degrees. Perfect, that's correct.Therefore, my answer is LB = 2.**Final Answer**The length of (LB) is (boxed{2})."},{"question":"Landon and Bryce together have 180 stickers.

She walks at 1 mile per hour, so:Time walking = 0.5 miles / 1 mph = 0.5 hours.Adding both times together gives the total time in hours:Total time = 0.1667 hours + 0.5 hours = 0.6667 hours.To convert this into minutes, I'll multiply by 60:Total time in minutes = 0.6667 hours * 60 minutes/hour ‚âà 40 minutes."},{"question":"Oliver chose to shovel driveways in his community for fifteen cents per square meter.

This can be done using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: ( frac{n(n + 1)}{2} ), where ( n = 30 ). Plugging in the value, the sum is ( frac{30 times 31}{2} = 465 ).Next, I'll determine how Emilio's changes affect each number. Emilio replaces every digit '2' with '1'. I'll examine each number from 1 to 30 to see if it contains the digit '2' and calculate the difference caused by the replacement.For single-digit numbers, only the number 2 is affected. Replacing '2' with '1' changes it to 1, reducing the sum by 1.For two-digit numbers, I'll consider both the tens and units places. Numbers like 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, and 29 have '2' in the tens place. Replacing '2' with '1' changes these numbers to 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19, respectively. The difference for each of these numbers is ( 20 - 10 = 10 ), so the total reduction for all these numbers is ( 10 times 10 = 100 ).Additionally, the number 12 has '2' in the units place. Replacing '2' with '1' changes it to 11, reducing the sum by 1.Adding up all the reductions: 1 (from the single-digit number) + 100 (from the two-digit numbers with '2' in the tens place) + 1 (from the number 12) equals a total reduction of 102.Finally, to find how much larger Star's sum is than Emilio's, I subtract the total reduction from Star's original sum: ( 465 - 102 = 363 ).

The nth term is n divided by 10 to the power of n. I need to find the sum of this series. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that there are formulas for the sum of infinite series, especially geometric series. But wait, this isn't a simple geometric series because each term has that n in the numerator. So, it's not just a constant ratio between terms; the numerator increases by 1 each time. That makes it an arithmetic-geometric series, I think. Yeah, because it's a combination of an arithmetic sequence (the numerator) and a geometric sequence (the denominator).I recall that for such series, there's a specific formula to find the sum. Let me try to remember it. I think it's something like S = a/(1 - r)¬≤, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, maybe I should derive it instead of trying to remember.Let me denote the sum as S. So,S = 1/10 + 2/10¬≤ + 3/10¬≥ + 4/10‚Å¥ + ... If I multiply both sides by 10, I get:10S = 1 + 2/10 + 3/10¬≤ + 4/10¬≥ + ... Hmm, interesting. Now, if I subtract the original S from this equation, maybe something will cancel out.So, subtracting S from 10S:10S - S = (1 + 2/10 + 3/10¬≤ + 4/10¬≥ + ...) - (1/10 + 2/10¬≤ + 3/10¬≥ + 4/10‚Å¥ + ...)Let me compute the left side first: 10S - S = 9S.Now, the right side: Let's subtract term by term.First term: 1 - 0 = 1.Second term: 2/10 - 1/10 = 1/10.Third term: 3/10¬≤ - 2/10¬≤ = 1/10¬≤.Fourth term: 4/10¬≥ - 3/10¬≥ = 1/10¬≥.And so on. So, the right side becomes:1 + 1/10 + 1/10¬≤ + 1/10¬≥ + ... Oh, that's a geometric series! The first term is 1, and the common ratio is 1/10.I know the formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series is a/(1 - r), where a is the first term and r is the common ratio, provided that |r| < 1.In this case, a = 1 and r = 1/10, so the sum is 1 / (1 - 1/10) = 1 / (9/10) = 10/9.So, going back, we have:9S = 10/9Therefore, S = (10/9) / 9 = 10/81.Wait, that seems right. Let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.1. I set S = 1/10 + 2/10¬≤ + 3/10¬≥ + ... 2. Multiplied both sides by 10: 10S = 1 + 2/10 + 3/10¬≤ + 4/10¬≥ + ... 3. Subtracted S from 10S: 9S = 1 + 1/10 + 1/10¬≤ + 1/10¬≥ + ... 4. Recognized the right side as a geometric series with sum 10/9.5. So, 9S = 10/9 => S = 10/81.Yes, that seems consistent. Let me see if there's another way to approach this, maybe using calculus or generating functions, but I think the method I used is solid.Alternatively, I remember that the general formula for the sum of the series Œ£ (n x^n) from n=1 to infinity is x/(1 - x)^2, for |x| < 1. In this case, x is 1/10.So, plugging x = 1/10 into the formula:Sum = (1/10) / (1 - 1/10)^2 = (1/10) / (9/10)^2 = (1/10) / (81/100) = (1/10) * (100/81) = 10/81.Yep, same result. So, that confirms it.Looking back at the options, (B) is 10/81, so that must be the correct answer.**Final Answer**boxed{B}"},{"question":"At a math contest, 57 students are wearing blue shirts, and another 75 students are wearing yellow shirts.

To alleviate the tension of electricity supply and demand, the power department adopted the method of replacing the electricity meter with a time-of-use meter. Before the replacement, the cost was 0.55 per kWh. After the replacement, the cost during the peak period is 0.60 per kWh, and during the off-peak period, it is 0.40 per kWh. After calculation, it was found that Mr. Wang's household saved 3 by using 100 kWh of electricity after the meter replacement compared to before. How many kWh did Mr. Wang's household use during the peak and off-peak periods, respectively?","answer":"Okay, so I need to figure out how much electricity Mr. Wang's household used during the peak and off-peak periods after they switched to the time-of-use meter. Let me try to break this down step by step.First, let me understand the problem. Before the meter replacement, the cost was a flat rate of 0.55 per kWh. After the replacement, the cost changed: 0.60 per kWh during peak hours (8 AM to 9 PM) and 0.40 per kWh during off-peak hours (9 PM to 8 AM). Mr. Wang saved 3 by using 100 kWh of electricity after the replacement compared to before. I need to find out how much he used during peak and off-peak.Let me define some variables to make this clearer. Let‚Äôs say:- Let ( x ) be the number of kWh used during peak hours.- Let ( y ) be the number of kWh used during off-peak hours.We know that the total electricity used is 100 kWh, so:[ x + y = 100 ]That's our first equation.Now, let's think about the costs. Before the replacement, the cost was 0.55 per kWh for all electricity. So, the total cost before replacement would be:[ 0.55 times 100 = 55 ] dollars.After the replacement, the cost is different for peak and off-peak. So, the total cost after replacement is:[ 0.60x + 0.40y ]According to the problem, Mr. Wang saved 3 by switching to the new meter. That means the cost after replacement is 3 less than the cost before replacement. So, we can write:[ 0.60x + 0.40y = 55 - 3 ][ 0.60x + 0.40y = 52 ]So now we have a system of two equations:1. ( x + y = 100 )2. ( 0.60x + 0.40y = 52 )I need to solve this system to find the values of ( x ) and ( y ).Let me solve equation 1 for one of the variables. Let's solve for ( y ):[ y = 100 - x ]Now, substitute this into equation 2:[ 0.60x + 0.40(100 - x) = 52 ]Let me compute this step by step.First, expand the equation:[ 0.60x + 0.40 times 100 - 0.40x = 52 ][ 0.60x + 40 - 0.40x = 52 ]Combine like terms:[ (0.60x - 0.40x) + 40 = 52 ][ 0.20x + 40 = 52 ]Subtract 40 from both sides:[ 0.20x = 12 ]Divide both sides by 0.20:[ x = 12 / 0.20 ][ x = 60 ]So, ( x = 60 ) kWh. That means Mr. Wang used 60 kWh during peak hours.Now, substitute ( x = 60 ) back into equation 1 to find ( y ):[ 60 + y = 100 ][ y = 40 ]So, ( y = 40 ) kWh. That means he used 40 kWh during off-peak hours.Let me double-check to make sure these numbers make sense.Before replacement, the cost was 0.55 per kWh for 100 kWh:[ 0.55 times 100 = 55 ] dollars.After replacement, the cost is:Peak: 60 kWh at 0.60: ( 60 times 0.60 = 36 ) dollars.Off-peak: 40 kWh at 0.40: ( 40 times 0.40 = 16 ) dollars.Total cost after replacement: ( 36 + 16 = 52 ) dollars.The difference is:[ 55 - 52 = 3 ] dollars.That matches the problem statement, so the calculations seem correct.Therefore, Mr. Wang used 60 kWh during peak hours and 40 kWh during off-peak hours.**Final Answer**Mr. Wang's household used boxed{60} kWh during the peak period and boxed{40} kWh during the off-peak period."},{"question":"The difference between the price of a strawberry and the price of a blueberry equals the price of a kiwi.

I know that the total cost of a strawberry and a blueberry is 80, and the strawberry costs 55. So, the blueberry must cost 80 minus 55, which is 25.Next, I'll find the price of a kiwi.

Find the length of segment AB.","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem about a curve C where for any point M on it, the distance from M to point F (1, 0) is 1 less than its distance to the line l: x = -2. I need to find the equation of curve C and then find the length of segment AB where a line with slope 1 passing through F intersects curve C.Starting with part (1). Hmm, okay, so it's talking about a point M(x, y) such that the distance from M to F is 1 less than the distance from M to the line x = -2. That sounds like a definition of a conic section, maybe a parabola or something else.Let me recall that for conic sections, the definition involves a focus and a directrix. For a parabola, the distance from any point on the parabola to the focus equals the distance to the directrix. But here, it's not equal; it's 1 less. So maybe it's a different kind of conic?Wait, if the distance to the focus is less than the distance to the directrix by a constant, that might be an ellipse or a hyperbola. Let me think.The general definition for a conic is that the ratio of the distance to the focus and the distance to the directrix is a constant called eccentricity (e). If e < 1, it's an ellipse; if e = 1, it's a parabola; if e > 1, it's a hyperbola.In this problem, the distance to F is 1 less than the distance to the line. So, mathematically, for any point M(x, y):Distance to F: sqrt[(x - 1)^2 + y^2]Distance to line l: |x - (-2)| = |x + 2|Given that distance to F is 1 less than distance to l:sqrt[(x - 1)^2 + y^2] = |x + 2| - 1Wait, but |x + 2| - 1 must be positive because the left side is a distance and hence non-negative. So, |x + 2| - 1 >= 0 => |x + 2| >= 1 => x + 2 >= 1 or x + 2 <= -1 => x >= -1 or x <= -3.So, the curve exists only where x >= -1 or x <= -3.But let's proceed. Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root. But before that, I should make sure that both sides are non-negative.So, sqrt[(x - 1)^2 + y^2] = |x + 2| - 1Since the left side is non-negative, the right side must also be non-negative, which we already considered.So, squaring both sides:(x - 1)^2 + y^2 = (|x + 2| - 1)^2But since |x + 2| is either x + 2 or -(x + 2), depending on x + 2 >= 0 or not. So, maybe I can consider two cases.Case 1: x + 2 >= 0, which is x >= -2Then, |x + 2| = x + 2, so the equation becomes:(x - 1)^2 + y^2 = (x + 2 - 1)^2 = (x + 1)^2Expanding both sides:Left: (x^2 - 2x + 1) + y^2Right: x^2 + 2x + 1Subtracting right from left:(x^2 - 2x + 1 + y^2) - (x^2 + 2x + 1) = 0Simplify:-4x + y^2 = 0 => y^2 = 4xSo, in this case, the equation is y^2 = 4x, which is a parabola opening to the right.But wait, in this case, x >= -2, but from earlier, we had that x >= -1 or x <= -3. So, in this case, x >= -1 because x >= -2 and x >= -1 is more restrictive.Case 2: x + 2 < 0, which is x < -2Then, |x + 2| = -(x + 2), so the equation becomes:(x - 1)^2 + y^2 = (-(x + 2) - 1)^2 = (-x - 3)^2 = (x + 3)^2Expanding both sides:Left: x^2 - 2x + 1 + y^2Right: x^2 + 6x + 9Subtracting right from left:(x^2 - 2x + 1 + y^2) - (x^2 + 6x + 9) = 0Simplify:-8x - 8 + y^2 = 0 => y^2 = 8x + 8So, y^2 = 8(x + 1), which is a parabola opening to the right as well, but shifted left by 1.But in this case, x < -2, but from earlier, we had x <= -3. So, in this case, x <= -3.So, putting both cases together, the curve C is composed of two parabolas:1. For x >= -1: y^2 = 4x2. For x <= -3: y^2 = 8(x + 1)Wait, but let me check if these two parabolas connect smoothly or if there's a gap.At x = -1, for the first parabola, y^2 = 4*(-1) = -4, which is not possible. So, actually, the first parabola starts at x = 0? Wait, no.Wait, y^2 = 4x is a parabola that opens to the right, starting at the vertex (0, 0). So, for x >= 0, it's valid, but in our case, the first case was x >= -1, but the equation y^2 = 4x would require x >= 0 because y^2 can't be negative. So, actually, the first case is only valid for x >= 0, but our earlier consideration was x >= -1. So, perhaps there's a mistake here.Wait, let's go back. When we considered x >= -2, we squared both sides and got y^2 = 4x. But in reality, y^2 = 4x is only valid when x >= 0 because y^2 cannot be negative. So, maybe the curve is only the right-opening parabola y^2 = 4x for x >= 0, and the left part is another parabola for x <= -3.But let's verify.Wait, in Case 1: x >= -2, but y^2 = 4x requires x >= 0, so the curve exists for x >= 0 in this case.In Case 2: x <= -3, and y^2 = 8(x + 1). Let's see, for x <= -3, x + 1 <= -2, so 8(x + 1) <= -16, which would make y^2 negative, which is impossible. So, this suggests that Case 2 doesn't yield any real points because y^2 can't be negative.Wait, that can't be right. Maybe I made a mistake in the squaring step.Let me re-examine the equation:sqrt[(x - 1)^2 + y^2] = |x + 2| - 1In Case 2: x < -2, so |x + 2| = -(x + 2). So, the equation becomes:sqrt[(x - 1)^2 + y^2] = -(x + 2) - 1 = -x - 3But the left side is a square root, which is non-negative, so the right side must also be non-negative. So, -x - 3 >= 0 => -x >= 3 => x <= -3.So, in this case, x <= -3.So, we have:sqrt[(x - 1)^2 + y^2] = -x - 3Squaring both sides:(x - 1)^2 + y^2 = (-x - 3)^2 = x^2 + 6x + 9Expanding left side:x^2 - 2x + 1 + y^2 = x^2 + 6x + 9Subtract x^2 from both sides:-2x + 1 + y^2 = 6x + 9Bring all terms to left:-8x - 8 + y^2 = 0 => y^2 = 8x + 8So, y^2 = 8(x + 1). So, for x <= -3, y^2 = 8(x + 1). But x <= -3, so x + 1 <= -2, so 8(x + 1) <= -16, which is negative. So, y^2 would have to be negative, which is impossible. Therefore, in this case, there are no real points. So, only Case 1 gives us real points.Wait, but in Case 1, we had x >= -2, but y^2 = 4x requires x >= 0. So, the curve exists only for x >= 0, and it's the parabola y^2 = 4x.But wait, the original condition was that distance to F is 1 less than distance to l. So, if we have a parabola y^2 = 4x, let's check if this satisfies the condition.Take a point on the parabola, say (1, 2). Distance to F(1,0) is sqrt[(1-1)^2 + (2-0)^2] = sqrt[0 + 4] = 2. Distance to line x = -2 is |1 - (-2)| = 3. So, 2 = 3 - 1, which is true.Another point, say (0,0). Distance to F is sqrt[(0-1)^2 + 0] = 1. Distance to line x = -2 is |0 - (-2)| = 2. So, 1 = 2 - 1, which is also true.Wait, but earlier, when we considered Case 2, we ended up with no real points because y^2 would be negative. So, maybe the entire curve is just the parabola y^2 = 4x for x >= 0.But let's think again. The original condition is that distance to F is 1 less than distance to l. So, if we take a point on the parabola y^2 = 4x, it satisfies this condition. But is there another part of the curve?Wait, if we take a point where x < -1, say x = -4. Let's compute distance to F and to the line.Distance to F(1,0): sqrt[(-4 - 1)^2 + y^2] = sqrt[25 + y^2]Distance to line x = -2: |-4 - (-2)| = |-2| = 2So, according to the condition, sqrt[25 + y^2] = 2 - 1 = 1. But sqrt[25 + y^2] = 1 implies 25 + y^2 = 1, which is impossible because y^2 would be negative. So, no such points exist for x < -1.Wait, but earlier, in Case 2, we had x <= -3, but that led to y^2 = 8(x + 1), which would require x + 1 >= 0 for y^2 to be non-negative, but x <= -3, so x + 1 <= -2, which is negative. So, no solution there.Therefore, the only real points are on the parabola y^2 = 4x for x >= 0.So, the equation of curve C is y^2 = 4x.Wait, but let me confirm with another point. Let's take x = 2, y = sqrt(8). Distance to F: sqrt[(2 - 1)^2 + (sqrt(8))^2] = sqrt[1 + 8] = 3. Distance to line x = -2: |2 - (-2)| = 4. So, 3 = 4 - 1, which is correct.Another point, x = 4, y = 4. Distance to F: sqrt[(4 - 1)^2 + 4^2] = sqrt[9 + 16] = 5. Distance to line: |4 - (-2)| = 6. So, 5 = 6 - 1, correct.So, it seems that the entire curve is just the parabola y^2 = 4x.Wait, but earlier, when I considered x >= -1, I thought that the equation would be y^2 = 4x, but actually, since y^2 = 4x requires x >= 0, the curve is only the right half of the parabola starting at (0,0).So, the equation of curve C is y^2 = 4x.Okay, so part (1) is solved.Now, moving on to part (2). A line l with a slope of 1 passes through point F(1, 0) and intersects curve C at points A and B. Find the length of segment AB.So, first, let's find the equation of line l. It has a slope of 1 and passes through (1, 0). So, using point-slope form:y - 0 = 1*(x - 1) => y = x - 1.Now, we need to find the points where this line intersects curve C, which is y^2 = 4x.So, substitute y = x - 1 into y^2 = 4x:(x - 1)^2 = 4xExpanding left side:x^2 - 2x + 1 = 4xBring all terms to left:x^2 - 6x + 1 = 0Now, solve for x using quadratic formula:x = [6 ¬± sqrt(36 - 4*1*1)] / 2 = [6 ¬± sqrt(32)] / 2 = [6 ¬± 4*sqrt(2)] / 2 = 3 ¬± 2*sqrt(2)So, the x-coordinates of points A and B are 3 + 2‚àö2 and 3 - 2‚àö2.Now, find the corresponding y-coordinates using y = x - 1:For x = 3 + 2‚àö2, y = (3 + 2‚àö2) - 1 = 2 + 2‚àö2For x = 3 - 2‚àö2, y = (3 - 2‚àö2) - 1 = 2 - 2‚àö2So, points A and B are:A: (3 + 2‚àö2, 2 + 2‚àö2)B: (3 - 2‚àö2, 2 - 2‚àö2)Now, to find the distance between A and B, we can use the distance formula:AB = sqrt[(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2]Compute x2 - x1: (3 - 2‚àö2) - (3 + 2‚àö2) = -4‚àö2Compute y2 - y1: (2 - 2‚àö2) - (2 + 2‚àö2) = -4‚àö2So, AB = sqrt[(-4‚àö2)^2 + (-4‚àö2)^2] = sqrt[(16*2) + (16*2)] = sqrt[32 + 32] = sqrt[64] = 8So, the length of segment AB is 8 units.Wait, let me double-check the calculations.First, solving y = x - 1 and y^2 = 4x:(x - 1)^2 = 4x => x^2 - 2x + 1 = 4x => x^2 - 6x + 1 = 0Discriminant: 36 - 4 = 32, so roots are [6 ¬± sqrt(32)]/2 = 3 ¬± 2‚àö2. Correct.Then, y = x - 1:For x = 3 + 2‚àö2, y = 2 + 2‚àö2For x = 3 - 2‚àö2, y = 2 - 2‚àö2Distance between (3 + 2‚àö2, 2 + 2‚àö2) and (3 - 2‚àö2, 2 - 2‚àö2):Œîx = (3 - 2‚àö2) - (3 + 2‚àö2) = -4‚àö2Œîy = (2 - 2‚àö2) - (2 + 2‚àö2) = -4‚àö2So, distance = sqrt[(-4‚àö2)^2 + (-4‚àö2)^2] = sqrt[(16*2) + (16*2)] = sqrt[32 + 32] = sqrt[64] = 8. Correct.So, the length of AB is 8.**Final Answer**(1) The equation of curve C is boxed{y^2 = 4x}.(2) The length of segment AB is boxed{8}."},{"question":"Find all functions continuous on the entire number line that satisfy the identity (5 f(x+y)=f(x) f(y)) and the condition (f(1)=10).","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find all functions that are continuous everywhere and satisfy the equation (5 f(x+y) = f(x) f(y)). Also, they give me a condition that (f(1) = 10). Hmm, okay, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, the equation given is (5 f(x+y) = f(x) f(y)). That looks a bit like a functional equation. I remember that functional equations often require us to find functions that satisfy certain properties. In this case, it's multiplicative but scaled by a factor of 5. Maybe I can manipulate it to look more familiar.Let me rewrite the equation:(f(x+y) = frac{1}{5} f(x) f(y)).Hmm, so the function evaluated at the sum of two variables is equal to the product of the function evaluated at each variable, scaled by 1/5. That reminds me of exponential functions because they have the property that (f(x+y) = f(x) f(y)). But here, there's an extra scaling factor. Maybe I can adjust for that.Let me think. If I let (g(x) = k f(x)) for some constant (k), maybe I can turn this into a multiplicative functional equation. Let's try that substitution.So, (g(x) = k f(x)). Then, (f(x) = frac{1}{k} g(x)). Let's plug this into the original equation:(5 f(x+y) = f(x) f(y))Substituting, we get:(5 cdot frac{1}{k} g(x+y) = left( frac{1}{k} g(x) right) left( frac{1}{k} g(y) right))Simplify both sides:Left side: (frac{5}{k} g(x+y))Right side: (frac{1}{k^2} g(x) g(y))So, we have:(frac{5}{k} g(x+y) = frac{1}{k^2} g(x) g(y))Multiply both sides by (k^2) to eliminate denominators:(5 k g(x+y) = g(x) g(y))Hmm, so now we have (g(x+y) = frac{1}{5k} g(x) g(y)). I want this to look like the exponential functional equation (g(x+y) = g(x) g(y)), so I need the coefficient (frac{1}{5k}) to be 1. Therefore, set (frac{1}{5k} = 1), which gives (k = frac{1}{5}).So, if I set (k = frac{1}{5}), then the equation becomes:(g(x+y) = g(x) g(y))Which is exactly the multiplicative functional equation. And since (f) is continuous, (g) will also be continuous because it's just a scalar multiple of (f). I remember that the only continuous solutions to (g(x+y) = g(x) g(y)) are exponential functions. Specifically, (g(x) = e^{c x}) for some constant (c).So, (g(x) = e^{c x}), which means (f(x) = frac{1}{k} g(x) = 5 e^{c x}).Now, we have (f(x) = 5 e^{c x}). We also know that (f(1) = 10). Let's use this condition to find the constant (c).Compute (f(1)):(f(1) = 5 e^{c cdot 1} = 5 e^{c})Given that (f(1) = 10), set up the equation:(5 e^{c} = 10)Divide both sides by 5:(e^{c} = 2)Take the natural logarithm of both sides:(c = ln 2)So, substituting back into (f(x)):(f(x) = 5 e^{(ln 2) x})Simplify the exponent:(e^{(ln 2) x} = (e^{ln 2})^{x} = 2^{x})Therefore, (f(x) = 5 cdot 2^{x}).Let me double-check to make sure this works.First, check the functional equation:(5 f(x+y) = 5 cdot 5 cdot 2^{x+y} = 25 cdot 2^{x+y})On the other hand, (f(x) f(y) = (5 cdot 2^{x})(5 cdot 2^{y}) = 25 cdot 2^{x+y})So, both sides are equal, which is good.Also, check the condition (f(1) = 5 cdot 2^{1} = 10), which matches.Additionally, since (f(x)) is an exponential function, it's continuous everywhere, which satisfies the problem's condition.Therefore, the function (f(x) = 5 cdot 2^{x}) is the solution.**Final Answer**The function is boxed{5 cdot 2^x}."},{"question":"The integer points (x, y) in the first quadrant satisfy x + y > 8 and x leq y leq 8. How many such integer points (x, y) are there?A. 16B. 18C. 20D. 24","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the number of integer points (x, y) in the first quadrant that satisfy two conditions: x + y > 8 and x ‚â§ y ‚â§ 8. The options are A. 16, B. 18, C. 20, D. 24. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, let me understand the constraints. We're dealing with integer points in the first quadrant, so both x and y are non-negative integers. The first condition is x + y > 8, which means that the sum of x and y has to be greater than 8. The second condition is x ‚â§ y ‚â§ 8, which tells me that y is at least as big as x and at most 8.So, I need to count all pairs (x, y) where x and y are integers, x ‚â• 0, y ‚â• 0, x ‚â§ y, y ‚â§ 8, and x + y > 8.Maybe it would help to visualize this on a coordinate plane. Since we're in the first quadrant, x and y are both positive. The line x + y = 8 is a straight line from (0,8) to (8,0). The region x + y > 8 would be above this line. But since we also have x ‚â§ y and y ‚â§ 8, we're confined to a specific area.Let me break down the constraints:1. x ‚â§ y: So, for each x, y can be from x up to 8.2. y ‚â§ 8: So, the maximum value y can take is 8.3. x + y > 8: So, for each x, y must be greater than 8 - x.So, perhaps I can approach this by fixing x and then determining the possible y values for each x.Let me consider x starting from 0 upwards, but since x ‚â§ y and y ‚â§ 8, x can't be more than 8. So x ranges from 0 to 8.But wait, if x is too large, say x = 8, then y has to be at least 8, but y can't be more than 8, so y = 8. Then x + y = 16, which is definitely greater than 8. So that's one point.Similarly, for x = 7, y has to be at least 7, but also y must satisfy 7 + y > 8, so y > 1. But since y ‚â• x =7, y can be 7 or 8. So for x=7, y can be 7 or 8, which gives two points.Wait, maybe I should formalize this.For each x from 0 to 8, y must satisfy:- y ‚â• x- y ‚â§ 8- y > 8 - xSo, combining these, for each x, y must be in the range max(x, 8 - x + 1) ‚â§ y ‚â§ 8.Wait, why 8 - x + 1? Because y must be greater than 8 - x, so the smallest integer y can be is 8 - x + 1.So, for each x, the lower bound for y is the maximum of x and (8 - x + 1). The upper bound is 8.Therefore, the number of y's for each x is 8 - max(x, 9 - x) + 1, but only if max(x, 9 - x) ‚â§ 8. Otherwise, there are no solutions for that x.Wait, let me think again. The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1. So, if the lower bound is L and upper bound is U, the number is U - L + 1, provided L ‚â§ U.So, for each x, L = max(x, 9 - x) and U = 8. So, if L > U, then there are no solutions for that x. Otherwise, the number of solutions is 8 - L + 1.Therefore, I can compute this for each x from 0 to 8.Let me make a table:x | L = max(x, 9 - x) | U = 8 | If L > U? | Number of y's---|------------------|-------|----------|------------0 | max(0,9) =9 | 8 | 9 >8 | 01 | max(1,8)=8 |8 |8=8 |8-8+1=12 | max(2,7)=7 |8 |7<=8 |8-7+1=23 | max(3,6)=6 |8 |6<=8 |8-6+1=34 | max(4,5)=5 |8 |5<=8 |8-5+1=45 | max(5,4)=5 |8 |5<=8 |8-5+1=46 | max(6,3)=6 |8 |6<=8 |8-6+1=37 | max(7,2)=7 |8 |7<=8 |8-7+1=28 | max(8,1)=8 |8 |8=8 |8-8+1=1Wait, let me compute this step by step.For x=0:- L = max(0, 9 - 0) = max(0,9)=9- U=8- Since 9 >8, number of y's=0x=1:- L = max(1, 9 -1)=max(1,8)=8- U=8- So, y can be 8 only. So, 1 point.x=2:- L = max(2, 9 -2)=max(2,7)=7- U=8- y can be 7 or 8. So, 2 points.x=3:- L = max(3, 9 -3)=max(3,6)=6- U=8- y can be 6,7,8. So, 3 points.x=4:- L = max(4, 9 -4)=max(4,5)=5- U=8- y can be 5,6,7,8. So, 4 points.x=5:- L = max(5, 9 -5)=max(5,4)=5- U=8- y can be 5,6,7,8. So, 4 points.x=6:- L = max(6, 9 -6)=max(6,3)=6- U=8- y can be 6,7,8. So, 3 points.x=7:- L = max(7, 9 -7)=max(7,2)=7- U=8- y can be 7,8. So, 2 points.x=8:- L = max(8, 9 -8)=max(8,1)=8- U=8- y can be 8 only. So, 1 point.Now, let's sum up the number of points for each x:x=0: 0x=1:1x=2:2x=3:3x=4:4x=5:4x=6:3x=7:2x=8:1Adding these up: 0 +1 +2 +3 +4 +4 +3 +2 +1.Let me compute this:Start from 0.0 +1 =11 +2=33 +3=66 +4=1010 +4=1414 +3=1717 +2=1919 +1=20.So, total number of points is 20. Hmm, option C is 20.Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when adding up, it's easy to make a mistake.So, 0 (x=0) +1 (x=1) is 1.1 +2 (x=2) is 3.3 +3 (x=3) is 6.6 +4 (x=4) is 10.10 +4 (x=5) is 14.14 +3 (x=6) is 17.17 +2 (x=7) is 19.19 +1 (x=8) is 20.Yes, that seems correct.Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a triangular number or something. But since the counts increase and then decrease, it's symmetric around x=4.5.From x=0 to x=4, the number of points increases: 0,1,2,3,4.From x=5 to x=8, it decreases:4,3,2,1.So, adding the increasing part: 0+1+2+3+4=10.Adding the decreasing part:4+3+2+1=10.Wait, but hold on, in my previous calculation, the total was 20, which is 10+10. But in the table above, x=4 contributes 4, x=5 contributes 4, so it's symmetric.But in the table, x=0 contributes 0, x=1 contributes 1, x=2 contributes 2, x=3 contributes 3, x=4 contributes 4, x=5 contributes 4, x=6 contributes 3, x=7 contributes 2, x=8 contributes1.So, it's symmetric around x=4.5.So, if I compute the sum as 2*(1+2+3+4) +4, but wait, x=4 is 4, which is the middle point.Wait, no, actually, from x=1 to x=8, it's symmetric around x=4.5.So, the sum is 2*(1+2+3+4) +4.Wait, 2*(1+2+3+4)=2*(10)=20, plus 4? Wait, no, that would be 24, which is not correct.Wait, maybe I should think differently.Wait, actually, the counts from x=1 to x=8 are symmetric, but x=4 is the midpoint.Wait, x=1 and x=8 both contribute 1.x=2 and x=7 both contribute 2.x=3 and x=6 both contribute 3.x=4 and x=5 both contribute 4.So, it's symmetric, so we can compute 2*(1+2+3+4) = 2*10=20.But wait, in our table, x=4 contributes 4 and x=5 contributes 4, so actually, the counts for x=4 and x=5 are both 4, so they are not mirrored. So, actually, the sum is 2*(1+2+3) + (4+4) = 2*6 +8=12+8=20.Yes, that makes sense.So, that confirms the total is 20.Alternatively, maybe I can think of the problem in terms of combinatorics.We need to count the number of integer solutions (x,y) with x ‚â§ y ‚â§8 and x + y >8.So, since x ‚â§ y, we can let x range from 0 to 8, and for each x, y ranges from x to 8, but also y >8 -x.So, for each x, y must be at least max(x, 9 -x).So, as I did before.Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the total number of points with x ‚â§ y ‚â§8 minus the number of points where x + y ‚â§8.So, total number of points with x ‚â§ y ‚â§8 is the number of integer points in the region where 0 ‚â§x ‚â§ y ‚â§8.This is equivalent to the number of pairs (x,y) with x ‚â§ y, which is the same as the combination C(9,2) +9, since for each y from 0 to8, x can be from0 toy.Wait, actually, the number of such points is the sum from y=0 to8 of (y +1) points, since for each y, x can be 0 toy.But wait, no, since x ‚â§ y, for each y, x can be from0 toy, so that's y+1 points.But since y ranges from0 to8, the total is sum_{y=0}^8 (y+1) = sum_{k=1}^9 k = (9*10)/2=45.So, total points with x ‚â§ y ‚â§8 is 45.Now, the number of points where x + y ‚â§8 and x ‚â§ y ‚â§8.So, if I can compute that, then subtracting from 45 will give me the desired count.So, let me compute the number of points with x ‚â§ y and x + y ‚â§8.Again, for each x, y must satisfy x ‚â§ y ‚â§ min(8, 8 -x).So, for each x, y ranges fromx to min(8,8 -x).But since x ‚â§ y, and x + y ‚â§8, so y ‚â§8 -x.But y must also be at leastx.So, for each x, y ranges fromx to min(8,8 -x).But for this to make sense, we need x ‚â§8 -x, which implies 2x ‚â§8, so x ‚â§4.So, for x=0 to4, y ranges fromx to8 -x.For x=5 to8, 8 -x <x, so there are no solutions.So, let's compute the number of points for x=0 to4.x=0:- y ranges from0 to8, but since x + y ‚â§8, and x=0, y can be0 to8. But since x ‚â§ y, y can be0 to8. So, y=0 to8, which is9 points.Wait, but wait, x=0, y must satisfy0 ‚â§ y ‚â§8 and0 + y ‚â§8, which is always true. So, y can be0 to8, which is9 points.But wait, in our original problem, we have x ‚â§ y ‚â§8, so for x=0, y can be0 to8, which is9 points.x=1:- y must satisfy1 ‚â§ y ‚â§ min(8,8 -1)=7- So, y=1 to7, which is7 points.x=2:- y must satisfy2 ‚â§ y ‚â§ min(8,8 -2)=6- So, y=2 to6, which is5 points.x=3:- y must satisfy3 ‚â§ y ‚â§ min(8,8 -3)=5- So, y=3 to5, which is3 points.x=4:- y must satisfy4 ‚â§ y ‚â§ min(8,8 -4)=4- So, y=4, which is1 point.x=5 to8:- No solutions, as 8 -x <x.So, total number of points with x + y ‚â§8 and x ‚â§ y is 9 +7 +5 +3 +1=25.Wait, 9 (x=0) +7 (x=1)=16, +5=21, +3=24, +1=25.So, total points with x + y ‚â§8 and x ‚â§ y is25.But earlier, total points with x ‚â§ y ‚â§8 is45.Therefore, the number of points with x + y >8 and x ‚â§ y ‚â§8 is45 -25=20.So, that's another way to get20.Therefore, the answer is20, which is optionC.I think that's solid. I approached it two different ways: directly counting for each x and subtracting the unwanted cases. Both gave me20. So, I feel confident that20 is the correct answer.**Final Answer**boxed{C}"},{"question":"Julia has 350 subscribers on her blog and 700 followers on Pinterest.

How many followers does Julia have across all her online platforms?","answer":"First, I'll identify the number of followers Julia has on each platform. She has 350 subscribers on her blog and 700 followers on Pinterest.Next, I'll calculate the total number of followers on her blog and Pinterest combined, which is 350 + 700 = 1050.Since the number of followers on Reddit is a quarter of this total, I'll divide 1050 by 4 to get 262.5 followers on Reddit.The number of followers on Discord is twice the number on Reddit, so I'll multiply 262.5 by 2 to find 525 followers on Discord.Julia has 350 more followers on Twitch than on Discord, so I'll add 350 to 525 to get 875 followers on Twitch.Finally, I'll sum up the followers from all platforms: 350 (blog) + 700 (Pinterest) + 262.5 (Reddit) + 525 (Discord) + 875 (Twitch) = 2712.5 followers in total."},{"question":"A row of eight candles is placed near a drafty window, causing them to burn unevenly. Each time a candle burns out, the remaining candles burn 1.5 times as fast as the previous one. How many times faster than the first candle does the last candle burn?","answer":"First, I need to understand how the burning rate of the candles changes as each candle burns out. The problem states that each time a candle burns out, the remaining candles burn 1.5 times as fast as the previous one. This means that the burning rate increases by a factor of 1.5 with each candle that burns out.There are eight candles in total. I'll consider each candle one by one and determine how many times faster each subsequent candle burns compared to the first one.For the second candle, since one candle has burned out, it burns 1.5 times faster than the first candle.For the third candle, two candles have burned out, so it burns 1.5 squared times faster than the first candle.Continuing this pattern, the eighth candle, which is the last one, will have burned out seven candles before it. Therefore, it burns 1.5 raised to the power of seven times faster than the first candle.Calculating 1.5 raised to the seventh power gives approximately 17.0859. This means the last candle burns about 17.09 times faster than the first candle."},{"question":"The textbook for mathematics has one-third as many pages as the textbook for language arts.

Prove that: 2(x-y-1)+ dfrac {1}{x^{2}-2xy+y^{2}}geqslant 1.","answer":"Okay, so I have this inequality to prove: (2(x - y - 1) + dfrac{1}{x^2 - 2xy + y^2} geq 1), where (x) and (y) are positive numbers and (x > y). Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, I notice that (x^2 - 2xy + y^2) is a familiar expression. Isn't that equal to ((x - y)^2)? Yeah, that's right. So, I can rewrite the inequality as:(2(x - y - 1) + dfrac{1}{(x - y)^2} geq 1).That seems a bit simpler. Let me let (t = x - y). Since (x > y) and both are positive, (t) must be a positive number. So, substituting (t) into the inequality, it becomes:(2(t - 1) + dfrac{1}{t^2} geq 1).Simplify the left side:(2t - 2 + dfrac{1}{t^2} geq 1).Let me bring the 1 to the left side:(2t - 2 + dfrac{1}{t^2} - 1 geq 0).Simplify that:(2t - 3 + dfrac{1}{t^2} geq 0).So, now the inequality is (2t - 3 + dfrac{1}{t^2} geq 0). I need to show that this is always true for (t > 0).Hmm, maybe I can consider this as a function of (t). Let me define (f(t) = 2t - 3 + dfrac{1}{t^2}). I need to show that (f(t) geq 0) for all (t > 0).To analyze this function, perhaps I can find its minimum value. If the minimum of (f(t)) is greater than or equal to zero, then the inequality holds for all (t > 0).To find the minimum, I can take the derivative of (f(t)) with respect to (t) and set it equal to zero.So, (f(t) = 2t - 3 + t^{-2}).Compute the derivative:(f'(t) = 2 - 2t^{-3}).Set (f'(t) = 0):(2 - dfrac{2}{t^3} = 0).Solving for (t):(2 = dfrac{2}{t^3}).Multiply both sides by (t^3):(2t^3 = 2).Divide both sides by 2:(t^3 = 1).Take the cube root:(t = 1).So, the critical point is at (t = 1). Now, I should check whether this is a minimum or a maximum. Let's compute the second derivative.First derivative: (f'(t) = 2 - 2t^{-3}).Second derivative: (f''(t) = 0 + 6t^{-4} = dfrac{6}{t^4}).Since (t > 0), (f''(t) = dfrac{6}{t^4} > 0). So, the function is concave upward at (t = 1), which means that this critical point is a local minimum.Therefore, the minimum value of (f(t)) occurs at (t = 1). Let's compute (f(1)):(f(1) = 2(1) - 3 + dfrac{1}{1^2} = 2 - 3 + 1 = 0).So, the minimum value of (f(t)) is 0, which occurs at (t = 1). Therefore, for all (t > 0), (f(t) geq 0). Hence, the original inequality holds.Wait, but let me double-check. If (t = 1), then (x - y = 1). So, substituting back, (x = y + 1). Let me plug this into the original inequality to see if it holds.Original inequality:(2(x - y - 1) + dfrac{1}{(x - y)^2} geq 1).If (x - y = 1), then:(2(1 - 1) + dfrac{1}{1^2} = 0 + 1 = 1), which equals 1. So, equality holds when (t = 1).What about other values? Let's pick (t = 2):(f(2) = 2(2) - 3 + dfrac{1}{4} = 4 - 3 + 0.25 = 1.25 geq 0). That's good.How about (t = 0.5):(f(0.5) = 2(0.5) - 3 + dfrac{1}{(0.5)^2} = 1 - 3 + 4 = 2 geq 0). Also good.What about as (t) approaches 0? Let's see:As (t to 0^+), (2t to 0), (-3) remains, and (dfrac{1}{t^2} to infty). So, overall, (f(t) to infty). So, it's positive there.As (t to infty), (2t) dominates, so (f(t) to infty). So, positive as well.Therefore, the function (f(t)) is always non-negative for (t > 0), with the minimum at 0 when (t = 1). Thus, the inequality holds.Wait, but just to be thorough, let me consider another approach. Maybe using AM-GM inequality or something else.Looking back at the inequality:(2(t - 1) + dfrac{1}{t^2} geq 1).Which simplifies to:(2t - 3 + dfrac{1}{t^2} geq 0).Is there a way to apply AM-GM here? Let's see. AM-GM requires positive terms, so that's fine since (t > 0).But I have a linear term and a reciprocal squared term. Maybe I can split the terms differently.Alternatively, perhaps I can consider (2t + dfrac{1}{t^2}) and compare it to 3.So, the inequality is (2t + dfrac{1}{t^2} geq 3).Is this always true for (t > 0)?Let me test (t = 1): (2(1) + 1 = 3), which is equal.For (t = 2): (4 + 1/4 = 4.25 > 3).For (t = 0.5): (1 + 4 = 5 > 3).So, it seems that (2t + dfrac{1}{t^2} geq 3) for (t > 0), with equality at (t = 1).Therefore, (2t + dfrac{1}{t^2} - 3 geq 0), which is exactly our function (f(t)). So, that's another way to see that (f(t) geq 0).But how can we prove (2t + dfrac{1}{t^2} geq 3)?Perhaps using calculus as before, but maybe using AM-GM.Let me try AM-GM. Let's consider the terms (2t) and (dfrac{1}{t^2}). Maybe split (2t) into two terms of (t) each.So, we have three terms: (t), (t), and (dfrac{1}{t^2}).Applying AM-GM to these three terms:(dfrac{t + t + dfrac{1}{t^2}}{3} geq sqrt[3]{t cdot t cdot dfrac{1}{t^2}}).Simplify the right side:(sqrt[3]{dfrac{t^2}{t^2}} = sqrt[3]{1} = 1).Multiply both sides by 3:(t + t + dfrac{1}{t^2} geq 3).Which is exactly (2t + dfrac{1}{t^2} geq 3). Perfect! So, by AM-GM inequality, the inequality holds, with equality when all terms are equal. That is, when (t = t = dfrac{1}{t^2}).So, (t = dfrac{1}{t^2}) implies (t^3 = 1), so (t = 1). That's consistent with our earlier result.Therefore, the inequality (2t + dfrac{1}{t^2} geq 3) holds for all (t > 0), with equality if and only if (t = 1). Thus, substituting back, the original inequality (2(x - y - 1) + dfrac{1}{(x - y)^2} geq 1) holds for all positive (x > y), with equality when (x - y = 1).So, that's another way to see it without using calculus. Using AM-GM is probably a more straightforward approach, especially if someone isn't as comfortable with calculus.Let me recap:1. Recognize that (x^2 - 2xy + y^2 = (x - y)^2).2. Let (t = x - y), so the inequality becomes (2(t - 1) + dfrac{1}{t^2} geq 1).3. Simplify to (2t - 3 + dfrac{1}{t^2} geq 0).4. Notice that this is equivalent to (2t + dfrac{1}{t^2} geq 3).5. Apply AM-GM inequality to the terms (t), (t), and (dfrac{1}{t^2}) to show that their sum is at least 3.6. Conclude that the original inequality holds, with equality when (t = 1).This seems solid. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning. Both the calculus approach and the AM-GM approach lead to the same conclusion, which reinforces that the inequality is indeed valid.Just to make sure, let me test another value. Suppose (x = 3) and (y = 1), so (t = 2).Compute the left side:(2(3 - 1 - 1) + dfrac{1}{(3 - 1)^2} = 2(1) + dfrac{1}{4} = 2 + 0.25 = 2.25), which is greater than 1.Another test: (x = 2), (y = 1), so (t = 1).Left side: (2(2 - 1 - 1) + dfrac{1}{(2 - 1)^2} = 2(0) + 1 = 1), which is equal to 1.And one more: (x = 1.5), (y = 0.5), so (t = 1).Left side: (2(1.5 - 0.5 - 1) + dfrac{1}{(1.5 - 0.5)^2} = 2(0) + 1 = 1). Again, equality.If I take (x = 4), (y = 1), (t = 3):Left side: (2(4 - 1 - 1) + dfrac{1}{(4 - 1)^2} = 2(2) + dfrac{1}{9} = 4 + 0.111... ‚âà 4.111), which is greater than 1.And a case where (t) is less than 1: (x = 1.2), (y = 0.5), so (t = 0.7).Left side: (2(1.2 - 0.5 - 1) + dfrac{1}{(0.7)^2}).Compute (1.2 - 0.5 - 1 = -0.3), so (2(-0.3) = -0.6).Compute (dfrac{1}{0.49} ‚âà 2.0408).So total: (-0.6 + 2.0408 ‚âà 1.4408), which is greater than 1.Wait, but (t = 0.7), so (2t + 1/t^2 = 1.4 + 2.0408 ‚âà 3.4408), which is greater than 3, so (3.4408 - 3 = 0.4408 geq 0). So, that's consistent.So, all these tests seem to confirm that the inequality holds.Therefore, I feel confident that the inequality is proven correctly.**Final Answer**boxed{1}"},{"question":"Select 3 individuals to participate in an English speech competition from a group of 5 male and 2 female students. Determine the total number of selection methods such that at least one female student participates.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to select 3 individuals from a group of 5 male and 2 female students for an English speech competition. The condition is that at least one female student must participate. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that when dealing with combinations, the total number of ways to choose k items from a set of n is given by the combination formula: C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!). So, maybe I can use this formula here.The group consists of 5 males and 2 females, making a total of 7 students. If I were to select 3 without any restrictions, the total number of ways would be C(7, 3). Let me calculate that: 7! / (3! * (7 - 3)!) = (7 * 6 * 5) / (3 * 2 * 1) = 35. So, there are 35 possible ways to choose any 3 students.But wait, the problem specifies that at least one female must be selected. That means I can't have all males in the selection. So, maybe it's easier to calculate the total number of ways without restrictions and then subtract the number of ways where no females are selected. That should give me the number of valid selections with at least one female.Let me test this idea. The total number of ways without restrictions is 35, as I found earlier. Now, the number of ways to select 3 males out of 5 is C(5, 3). Calculating that: 5! / (3! * (5 - 3)!) = (5 * 4 * 3) / (3 * 2 * 1) = 10. So, there are 10 ways to choose all males.Therefore, the number of ways to select 3 students with at least one female is the total number of ways minus the all-male selections: 35 - 10 = 25. So, there are 25 valid selection methods.Alternatively, I can think about this problem by considering the different cases where at least one female is included. That is, the selection can have 1 female and 2 males, or 2 females and 1 male. Since there are only 2 females, we can't have more than 2 females in the selection.Let me calculate each case separately and then add them together.First case: 1 female and 2 males. The number of ways to choose 1 female from 2 is C(2, 1) = 2. The number of ways to choose 2 males from 5 is C(5, 2). Calculating that: 5! / (2! * (5 - 2)!) = (5 * 4) / (2 * 1) = 10. So, the number of ways for this case is 2 * 10 = 20.Second case: 2 females and 1 male. The number of ways to choose 2 females from 2 is C(2, 2) = 1. The number of ways to choose 1 male from 5 is C(5, 1) = 5. So, the number of ways for this case is 1 * 5 = 5.Adding both cases together: 20 + 5 = 25. That matches the previous result, so that's reassuring.Hmm, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake, let me go through the calculations again.Total number of ways without restrictions: C(7, 3) = 35. Correct.Number of all-male selections: C(5, 3) = 10. Correct.Subtracting gives 25. Correct.Alternatively, breaking into cases:1 female and 2 males: C(2,1)*C(5,2) = 2*10=20.2 females and 1 male: C(2,2)*C(5,1)=1*5=5.Total: 20+5=25. Correct.So, both methods give the same answer, which is good. It seems like 25 is the correct number of selection methods where at least one female participates.I don't think I missed any cases because the only possibilities are 1 female and 2 males, or 2 females and 1 male. Since there are only 2 females, we can't have more than that. So, all scenarios are covered.Just to think about it another way, if I were to list all possible combinations, how many would include at least one female? Well, since there are only 2 females, the number of combinations where at least one is included should be manageable.But listing them all would be tedious, especially since there are 35 total combinations. However, since the two methods I used both gave 25, and they are standard combinatorial approaches, I feel confident that 25 is the correct answer.Therefore, the total number of selection methods such that at least one female student participates is 25.**Final Answer**The total number of selection methods is boxed{25}."},{"question":"Given that ( x ) and ( y ) are real numbers and ( left| x - frac{1}{2} right| + sqrt{y^2 - 1} = 0 ).Let ( p = |x| + |y| ), find the value of ( p ).","answer":"To solve the equation ( left| x - frac{1}{2} right| + sqrt{y^2 - 1} = 0 ), I start by recognizing that both terms on the left side are non-negative.Since the sum of two non-negative numbers is zero, each term must individually be zero. Therefore, ( left| x - frac{1}{2} right| = 0 ) and ( sqrt{y^2 - 1} = 0 ).From ( left| x - frac{1}{2} right| = 0 ), it follows that ( x = frac{1}{2} ).Similarly, ( sqrt{y^2 - 1} = 0 ) implies that ( y^2 - 1 = 0 ), so ( y = pm 1 ).Finally, to find ( p = |x| + |y| ), I substitute the values of ( x ) and ( y ):[p = left| frac{1}{2} right| + |1| = frac{1}{2} + 1 = frac{3}{2}]"},{"question":"In Mr. Johnson's class, there are 36 students.

Find ( frac{yz}{x} + frac{xz}{y} + frac{xy}{z} ).","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the value of ( frac{yz}{x} + frac{xz}{y} + frac{xy}{z} ) where ( x, y, z ) are the roots of the cubic equation ( t^3 - 2t^2 - 9t - 1 = 0 ). Hmm, okay, let me try to figure this out step by step.First, I remember that for a cubic equation ( t^3 + at^2 + bt + c = 0 ), the sum of the roots ( x + y + z = -a ), the sum of the products ( xy + yz + zx = b ), and the product of the roots ( xyz = -c ). So, in this case, our equation is ( t^3 - 2t^2 - 9t - 1 = 0 ). Comparing this to the general form, ( a = -2 ), ( b = -9 ), and ( c = -1 ).Wait, actually, hold on. The general form is ( t^3 + at^2 + bt + c = 0 ), so in our case, the equation is ( t^3 - 2t^2 - 9t - 1 = 0 ). So, that would mean ( a = -2 ), ( b = -9 ), and ( c = -1 ). Therefore, the sum of the roots ( x + y + z = -a = 2 ), the sum of the products ( xy + yz + zx = b = -9 ), and the product ( xyz = -c = 1 ). Got that down.So, ( x + y + z = 2 ), ( xy + yz + zx = -9 ), and ( xyz = 1 ). Now, I need to find ( frac{yz}{x} + frac{xz}{y} + frac{xy}{z} ). Hmm, that expression looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can find a way to express it in terms of the known sums and products.Let me denote ( S = frac{yz}{x} + frac{xz}{y} + frac{xy}{z} ). I need to find ( S ). Let me see if I can manipulate this expression.First, notice that each term in ( S ) is a product of two roots divided by the third. So, for example, ( frac{yz}{x} ) is ( frac{yz}{x} ). Since ( xyz = 1 ), I can express ( frac{yz}{x} ) as ( frac{yz}{x} = frac{1}{x^2} ) because ( yz = frac{1}{x} ) (since ( xyz = 1 ) implies ( yz = frac{1}{x} )). Wait, is that correct?Wait, no, actually, ( yz = frac{1}{x} ) only if ( xyz = 1 ). So, ( yz = frac{1}{x} ), so ( frac{yz}{x} = frac{1}{x^2} ). Similarly, ( frac{xz}{y} = frac{1}{y^2} ) and ( frac{xy}{z} = frac{1}{z^2} ). So, actually, ( S = frac{1}{x^2} + frac{1}{y^2} + frac{1}{z^2} ). Hmm, that's an interesting observation.So, now, instead of dealing with ( frac{yz}{x} + frac{xz}{y} + frac{xy}{z} ), I can think of it as ( frac{1}{x^2} + frac{1}{y^2} + frac{1}{z^2} ). Maybe that's easier to handle. Let me see if I can find an expression for ( frac{1}{x^2} + frac{1}{y^2} + frac{1}{z^2} ).I remember that ( frac{1}{x^2} + frac{1}{y^2} + frac{1}{z^2} ) can be expressed in terms of ( left( frac{1}{x} + frac{1}{y} + frac{1}{z} right)^2 - 2 left( frac{1}{xy} + frac{1}{yz} + frac{1}{zx} right) ). Let me verify that.Yes, because ( (a + b + c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + bc + ca) ). So, rearranged, ( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = (a + b + c)^2 - 2(ab + bc + ca) ). So, if I let ( a = frac{1}{x} ), ( b = frac{1}{y} ), ( c = frac{1}{z} ), then:( frac{1}{x^2} + frac{1}{y^2} + frac{1}{z^2} = left( frac{1}{x} + frac{1}{y} + frac{1}{z} right)^2 - 2 left( frac{1}{xy} + frac{1}{yz} + frac{1}{zx} right) ).Okay, so I need to find ( frac{1}{x} + frac{1}{y} + frac{1}{z} ) and ( frac{1}{xy} + frac{1}{yz} + frac{1}{zx} ).Let me compute ( frac{1}{x} + frac{1}{y} + frac{1}{z} ) first. I know that ( frac{1}{x} + frac{1}{y} + frac{1}{z} = frac{xy + yz + zx}{xyz} ). From earlier, ( xy + yz + zx = -9 ) and ( xyz = 1 ). So, ( frac{1}{x} + frac{1}{y} + frac{1}{z} = frac{-9}{1} = -9 ).Okay, so ( frac{1}{x} + frac{1}{y} + frac{1}{z} = -9 ). Now, what about ( frac{1}{xy} + frac{1}{yz} + frac{1}{zx} )?Similarly, ( frac{1}{xy} + frac{1}{yz} + frac{1}{zx} = frac{z + x + y}{xyz} ). Because if you take ( frac{1}{xy} = frac{z}{xyz} ), same for the others. So, ( frac{1}{xy} + frac{1}{yz} + frac{1}{zx} = frac{x + y + z}{xyz} ).We know ( x + y + z = 2 ) and ( xyz = 1 ), so ( frac{1}{xy} + frac{1}{yz} + frac{1}{zx} = frac{2}{1} = 2 ).Great, so now plugging back into the expression for ( S ):( S = left( -9 right)^2 - 2 times 2 = 81 - 4 = 77 ).Wait, hold on, that seems straightforward. So, ( S = 77 ). Hmm, but let me double-check my steps because sometimes when dealing with reciprocals and squares, it's easy to make a mistake.So, starting again: ( S = frac{yz}{x} + frac{xz}{y} + frac{xy}{z} ). Since ( xyz = 1 ), each term ( frac{yz}{x} = frac{1}{x^2} ), so ( S = frac{1}{x^2} + frac{1}{y^2} + frac{1}{z^2} ).Then, ( frac{1}{x^2} + frac{1}{y^2} + frac{1}{z^2} = left( frac{1}{x} + frac{1}{y} + frac{1}{z} right)^2 - 2 left( frac{1}{xy} + frac{1}{yz} + frac{1}{zx} right) ).We found ( frac{1}{x} + frac{1}{y} + frac{1}{z} = -9 ), so squared is 81, and ( frac{1}{xy} + frac{1}{yz} + frac{1}{zx} = 2 ), so 2 times that is 4. Therefore, 81 - 4 is 77. So, yes, that seems consistent.Alternatively, maybe I can approach this problem without converting it into reciprocals. Let me think.Another way: Let's consider ( frac{yz}{x} + frac{xz}{y} + frac{xy}{z} ). Let me factor this expression. Hmm, not sure if that's straightforward.Alternatively, maybe I can write this as ( frac{yz}{x} + frac{xz}{y} + frac{xy}{z} = frac{y z^2 + x z^2 + x y^2}{x y z} ). Wait, no, that doesn't seem right.Wait, actually, let me try to combine the terms. Let's see:( frac{yz}{x} + frac{xz}{y} + frac{xy}{z} = frac{y z}{x} + frac{x z}{y} + frac{x y}{z} ).If I factor each term, it's ( y z cdot frac{1}{x} + x z cdot frac{1}{y} + x y cdot frac{1}{z} ).Alternatively, maybe I can write this as ( frac{y z}{x} + frac{x z}{y} + frac{x y}{z} = frac{y z}{x} + frac{x z}{y} + frac{x y}{z} ).Hmm, perhaps I can factor out ( x y z ) from the numerator? Let me see.Wait, if I multiply numerator and denominator by ( x y z ), but that might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe I can write each term as ( frac{y z}{x} = frac{(y z)}{x} = frac{(y z)}{x} cdot frac{xyz}{xyz} = frac{(y z)(xyz)}{x cdot xyz} = frac{(y z)^2}{x^2 y z} ). Hmm, that seems more complicated.Alternatively, perhaps I can express ( frac{yz}{x} ) as ( frac{yz}{x} = frac{(yz)}{x} ). Since ( xyz = 1 ), then ( yz = frac{1}{x} ), so ( frac{yz}{x} = frac{1}{x^2} ). So, that brings us back to the earlier conclusion that ( S = frac{1}{x^2} + frac{1}{y^2} + frac{1}{z^2} ).So, that seems consistent. Therefore, my initial approach was correct, and ( S = 77 ).Wait, but just to be thorough, let me check another way. Maybe using symmetric sums or something else.Let me denote ( a = x + y + z = 2 ), ( b = xy + yz + zx = -9 ), ( c = xyz = 1 ).I need to find ( frac{yz}{x} + frac{xz}{y} + frac{xy}{z} ). Let me denote this as ( S ).Alternatively, ( S = frac{yz}{x} + frac{xz}{y} + frac{xy}{z} ).Let me write ( S = frac{yz}{x} + frac{xz}{y} + frac{xy}{z} = frac{y z^2 + x z^2 + x y^2}{x y z} ). Wait, no, that's not correct.Wait, actually, to combine the terms, we need a common denominator. The common denominator would be ( x y z ). So, let's rewrite each term:( frac{yz}{x} = frac{y z cdot y z}{x cdot y z} = frac{(y z)^2}{x y z} ). Similarly, ( frac{xz}{y} = frac{(x z)^2}{x y z} ), and ( frac{xy}{z} = frac{(x y)^2}{x y z} ).Therefore, ( S = frac{(y z)^2 + (x z)^2 + (x y)^2}{x y z} ).So, ( S = frac{(y z)^2 + (x z)^2 + (x y)^2}{x y z} ).Now, since ( x y z = 1 ), the denominator is 1, so ( S = (y z)^2 + (x z)^2 + (x y)^2 ).So, ( S = (xy)^2 + (yz)^2 + (zx)^2 ).Hmm, okay, so ( S = (xy)^2 + (yz)^2 + (zx)^2 ). I can compute this using the square of the sum ( (xy + yz + zx)^2 ).We know that ( (xy + yz + zx)^2 = (xy)^2 + (yz)^2 + (zx)^2 + 2(x y^2 z + x^2 y z + x y z^2) ). Wait, no, actually, let me recall the formula:( (a + b + c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + ac + bc) ).So, in this case, ( a = xy ), ( b = yz ), ( c = zx ). Therefore,( (xy + yz + zx)^2 = (xy)^2 + (yz)^2 + (zx)^2 + 2(xy cdot yz + xy cdot zx + yz cdot zx) ).Simplify the cross terms:( xy cdot yz = x y^2 z ), ( xy cdot zx = x^2 y z ), ( yz cdot zx = x y z^2 ).So, ( (xy + yz + zx)^2 = (xy)^2 + (yz)^2 + (zx)^2 + 2(x y^2 z + x^2 y z + x y z^2) ).Factor out ( x y z ) from the cross terms:( 2(x y z)(y + x + z) ).So, ( (xy + yz + zx)^2 = (xy)^2 + (yz)^2 + (zx)^2 + 2(x y z)(x + y + z) ).Therefore, ( (xy)^2 + (yz)^2 + (zx)^2 = (xy + yz + zx)^2 - 2(x y z)(x + y + z) ).We know ( xy + yz + zx = -9 ), so ( (xy + yz + zx)^2 = (-9)^2 = 81 ). Also, ( x y z = 1 ) and ( x + y + z = 2 ). Therefore,( (xy)^2 + (yz)^2 + (zx)^2 = 81 - 2(1)(2) = 81 - 4 = 77 ).So, ( S = 77 ). That's consistent with my earlier result. So, that's good, both approaches lead to the same answer.Just to make sure, let me recap:1. Recognize that ( frac{yz}{x} + frac{xz}{y} + frac{xy}{z} ) can be rewritten in terms of reciprocals squared or as the sum of squares of the products of roots.2. Either way, using symmetric sums and known values from Vieta's formula, we can compute the required expression.3. Both methods lead to the same result, which is 77.Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 77.**Final Answer**boxed{77}"},{"question":"Given left{begin{array}{l}x=1 y=3end{array}right. is a solution to the equation 3mx-2y=9, find m.","answer":"To find the value of ( m ), I'll start by substituting the given solution ( x = 1 ) and ( y = 3 ) into the equation ( 3mx - 2y = 9 ).Substituting the values, the equation becomes:[3m(1) - 2(3) = 9]Simplifying the equation:[3m - 6 = 9]Next, I'll solve for ( m ) by isolating it on one side of the equation.

The condition is about sequences of distinct positive integers. Specifically, for any sequence ( {a_1, a_2, ldots} ) where each term is a distinct positive integer, and for any positive integer ( n ), ( a_n leq a n ), then there must exist infinitely many terms in the sequence such that their digit sums in base 4038 are not divisible by 2019.Hmm, okay. Let me try to unpack this step by step.First, the problem is about sequences of distinct positive integers. So, each term in the sequence is unique, and they are all positive integers. The condition given is that for any positive integer ( n ), the ( n )-th term of the sequence ( a_n ) is less than or equal to ( a times n ). So, ( a ) is like a scaling factor that determines how \\"fast\\" the sequence grows. Since ( a geq 1 ), the sequence can't grow too slowly; each term can't be more than ( a ) times its position.The main condition is that in such a sequence, there must be infinitely many terms whose digit sums in base 4038 are not divisible by 2019. So, I need to ensure that no matter how you construct such a sequence (with distinct positive integers and each term bounded by ( a n )), you can't have all but finitely many terms with digit sums divisible by 2019.Wait, so the negation of that would be: if ( a ) is too small, maybe you can construct a sequence where only finitely many terms have digit sums not divisible by 2019. So, we need to find the minimal ( a ) such that this is impossible, meaning that no matter how you choose the sequence, you can't avoid having infinitely many terms with digit sums not divisible by 2019.So, perhaps the idea is to relate the growth rate of the sequence (controlled by ( a )) to the distribution of digit sums modulo 2019 in base 4038.Let me think about digit sums in base 4038. The digit sum of a number in base ( b ) is the sum of its digits when written in that base. For example, in base 10, the digit sum of 123 is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.In base 4038, each digit can range from 0 to 4037. So, the digit sum can be as large as 4037 times the number of digits. But since we're dealing with digit sums modulo 2019, perhaps there's a connection.Wait, 4038 is exactly twice 2019. So, 4038 = 2 √ó 2019. That might be important. So, the base is twice the modulus we're considering for the digit sums.I wonder if this relationship can help in analyzing the digit sums modulo 2019.Also, the problem is about sequences where each term is bounded by ( a n ). So, the terms can't grow too quickly. If ( a ) is too small, maybe the terms are constrained enough that you can make their digit sums all (or almost all) divisible by 2019. But if ( a ) is large enough, then the terms can vary enough that you can't control their digit sums, so infinitely many will have digit sums not divisible by 2019.So, perhaps the key is to find the threshold ( a ) where this transition happens.Let me consider how digit sums behave. In base ( b ), the digit sum modulo ( b-1 ) is equal to the number itself modulo ( b-1 ). This is because of the divisibility rule for 9 in base 10, which generalizes to other bases.But in our case, the base is 4038, and we're looking at digit sums modulo 2019. Since 4038 is 2 √ó 2019, perhaps there's a similar property here.Wait, let's recall that in base ( b ), the digit sum modulo ( b-1 ) is equal to the number modulo ( b-1 ). So, in our case, if we consider modulo 2019, which is half of 4038, does a similar property hold?Let me check: Let's take a number ( N ) in base 4038, written as ( N = d_k d_{k-1} ldots d_1 d_0 ), so ( N = d_0 + d_1 times 4038 + d_2 times 4038^2 + ldots + d_k times 4038^k ).Then, the digit sum ( S(N) = d_0 + d_1 + ldots + d_k ).We want to relate ( S(N) ) modulo 2019 to ( N ) modulo something. Since 4038 = 2 √ó 2019, 4038 ‚â° 0 mod 2019, right? Because 4038 is a multiple of 2019.Wait, 4038 is 2 √ó 2019, so 4038 ‚â° 0 mod 2019. Therefore, each power of 4038 is also 0 mod 2019, except for 4038^0 = 1.Therefore, ( N equiv d_0 + d_1 times 0 + d_2 times 0 + ldots + d_k times 0 equiv d_0 mod 2019 ).So, ( N equiv d_0 mod 2019 ). But the digit sum ( S(N) = d_0 + d_1 + ldots + d_k ). So, ( S(N) equiv d_0 + d_1 + ldots + d_k mod 2019 ).But ( N equiv d_0 mod 2019 ). So, ( S(N) equiv N + (d_1 + d_2 + ldots + d_k) mod 2019 ).Hmm, that might not directly relate ( S(N) ) to ( N ) modulo 2019. Maybe I need a different approach.Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the possible digit sums modulo 2019. Since each digit is between 0 and 4037, the digit sum can be quite large. But when considering modulo 2019, the digit sum can be any residue from 0 to 2018.But the key point is whether we can control the digit sums to be divisible by 2019. If the numbers in the sequence are constrained enough, perhaps we can make their digit sums all congruent to 0 modulo 2019. But if the numbers are too varied, then their digit sums can't all be controlled, so infinitely many will not be divisible by 2019.So, the problem reduces to finding the minimal ( a ) such that any sequence with terms ( a_n leq a n ) must contain infinitely many terms with digit sums not divisible by 2019.Alternatively, if ( a ) is too small, maybe we can construct a sequence where almost all terms have digit sums divisible by 2019, but once ( a ) is large enough, such a construction is impossible.So, perhaps the critical value of ( a ) is 2019 or something related.Wait, but 4038 is 2 √ó 2019, so maybe 2019 is the key here.Alternatively, maybe the critical ( a ) is 2, since 4038 is twice 2019.Wait, let me think about the density of numbers with digit sums divisible by 2019. If the numbers are too dense, perhaps you can't avoid having many with digit sums not divisible by 2019.But I need to relate the growth rate ( a ) to the distribution of digit sums.Alternatively, perhaps I can model this probabilistically. If the numbers are chosen such that each digit is random, then the digit sum modulo 2019 would be roughly uniformly distributed. So, the probability that a random number has digit sum divisible by 2019 is about 1/2019. Therefore, if the sequence is \\"dense\\" enough, the number of terms with digit sums not divisible by 2019 would be infinite.But in our case, the sequence is not random; it's constructed adversarially to try to have as many digit sums divisible by 2019 as possible. So, the question is whether, given the growth rate ( a ), such a construction is possible or not.So, perhaps if ( a ) is too small, the sequence is constrained enough that you can make all but finitely many terms have digit sums divisible by 2019. But once ( a ) is large enough, you can't do that anymore.So, maybe the critical value is when the number of possible residues modulo 2019 is less than the number of terms we can have in the sequence up to a certain point.Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the pigeonhole principle. If the sequence is growing too quickly, then the number of terms up to ( N ) is about ( N / a ), and the number of possible residues modulo 2019 is 2019. So, if ( N / a ) is much larger than 2019, then by the pigeonhole principle, some residues must repeat, but I'm not sure how that relates to digit sums.Alternatively, maybe I need to think about how many numbers up to ( a n ) have digit sums divisible by 2019. If the density is less than 1, then in a sequence of density ( 1/a ), you can't have all terms with digit sums divisible by 2019.Wait, perhaps the density of numbers with digit sums divisible by 2019 is roughly 1/2019, as I thought earlier. So, if the sequence has density ( 1/a ), then the expected number of terms with digit sums not divisible by 2019 is roughly ( n times (1 - 1/2019) times (1/a) ). So, if ( a ) is less than 2019, then the expected number is still going to infinity, meaning that there are infinitely many terms with digit sums not divisible by 2019.Wait, but that reasoning might not be precise because the events are not independent.Alternatively, perhaps I can use the concept of natural density. The natural density of numbers with digit sums divisible by 2019 is 1/2019. So, in any sequence with positive density, the intersection with this set would have density at least the minimum of the two densities. But I'm not sure.Wait, let me think differently. Suppose we fix ( a ). Then, the sequence ( a_n ) satisfies ( a_n leq a n ). So, the number of terms up to ( N ) is roughly ( N / a ). So, the density is ( 1/a ).If ( 1/a > 1/2019 ), meaning ( a < 2019 ), then the density of the sequence is higher than the density of numbers with digit sums divisible by 2019. So, maybe in this case, the sequence must contain infinitely many numbers with digit sums not divisible by 2019.But if ( a geq 2019 ), then the density ( 1/a ) is less than or equal to ( 1/2019 ), so perhaps you can construct a sequence where all terms have digit sums divisible by 2019.Wait, but that might not necessarily be true because even if the density is lower, the sequence could still be constructed to miss the numbers with digit sums not divisible by 2019.Wait, perhaps the key is that if ( a < 2019 ), then the sequence is \\"dense\\" enough that it must intersect the set of numbers with digit sums not divisible by 2019 infinitely often. Whereas if ( a geq 2019 ), the sequence can be sparse enough to avoid those numbers.But I need to verify this.Let me consider the case when ( a = 2019 ). Then, the sequence can have terms up to ( 2019 n ). So, the number of terms up to ( N ) is roughly ( N / 2019 ). The density is ( 1/2019 ).Now, the set of numbers with digit sums divisible by 2019 has density ( 1/2019 ). So, in theory, you could have a sequence that exactly matches this set, picking one number from each residue class. But wait, the problem is that the sequence must consist of distinct positive integers, but it's not necessarily required to be increasing or anything else.Wait, but the problem says \\"for every sequence\\", so even if you try to construct a sequence that only includes numbers with digit sums divisible by 2019, as long as ( a ) is large enough, you might be able to do that.But if ( a ) is too small, maybe you can't avoid including numbers with digit sums not divisible by 2019.Wait, perhaps the critical value is ( a = 2019 ). Because if ( a < 2019 ), then the sequence is too dense to avoid having infinitely many terms with digit sums not divisible by 2019. But if ( a geq 2019 ), then you can construct a sequence that only includes numbers with digit sums divisible by 2019.But I need to think more carefully.Let me consider the case when ( a = 2019 ). Then, each term ( a_n leq 2019 n ). So, the number of terms up to ( N ) is roughly ( N / 2019 ). The number of numbers up to ( N ) with digit sums divisible by 2019 is roughly ( N / 2019 ). So, in this case, it's possible to construct a sequence where each term is a number with digit sum divisible by 2019, just by picking one such number for each ( n ).But wait, is that possible? Because the numbers with digit sums divisible by 2019 are spread out, but their density is ( 1/2019 ). So, for each ( n ), you can find a number ( a_n leq 2019 n ) with digit sum divisible by 2019.But is that necessarily true? For each ( n ), can we find a number ( leq 2019 n ) with digit sum divisible by 2019?Well, considering that the numbers with digit sums divisible by 2019 are distributed regularly, I think that yes, for each ( n ), there exists such a number. So, you can construct a sequence where each term is such a number, and thus, all terms have digit sums divisible by 2019. Therefore, for ( a = 2019 ), it's possible to have a sequence where only finitely many terms (in fact, none) have digit sums not divisible by 2019.But wait, the problem says \\"for every sequence\\", so if ( a = 2019 ), there exists a sequence where all terms have digit sums divisible by 2019, which would violate the condition. Therefore, ( a ) must be greater than 2019.Wait, no. Wait, the problem states that for a given ( a ), for every sequence ( {a_n} ) with ( a_n leq a n ), there exist infinitely many terms with digit sums not divisible by 2019. So, if ( a = 2019 ), we just saw that there exists a sequence where all terms have digit sums divisible by 2019, which would mean that the condition is not satisfied. Therefore, ( a ) must be greater than 2019.Wait, but if ( a > 2019 ), say ( a = 2020 ), then for each ( n ), ( a_n leq 2020 n ). The number of terms up to ( N ) is roughly ( N / 2020 ). The number of numbers up to ( N ) with digit sums divisible by 2019 is roughly ( N / 2019 ). So, ( N / 2020 ) is slightly less than ( N / 2019 ). So, in this case, the density of the sequence is slightly less than the density of the numbers with digit sums divisible by 2019. So, perhaps you can still construct a sequence where all terms have digit sums divisible by 2019.Wait, but how? Because the density of the sequence is slightly less, but the density of the target set is slightly higher. So, maybe you can't cover all the terms with the target set.Wait, perhaps the key is that if ( a ) is greater than 2019, then the sequence can include numbers beyond the range where you can control their digit sums. So, perhaps you can't avoid having infinitely many terms with digit sums not divisible by 2019.Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try a different approach.Suppose ( a ) is such that ( a > 2019 ). Then, for each ( n ), ( a_n leq a n ). So, the number of terms up to ( N ) is roughly ( N / a ). The number of numbers up to ( N ) with digit sums divisible by 2019 is roughly ( N / 2019 ).So, if ( a > 2019 ), then ( N / a < N / 2019 ). So, the number of terms in the sequence is less than the number of numbers with digit sums divisible by 2019. So, in this case, it's possible that the sequence could be constructed to include only numbers with digit sums divisible by 2019, because there are enough such numbers.Wait, but that contradicts my earlier thought. Hmm.Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the growth rate. If ( a ) is too small, the sequence is too dense, so it must include numbers with all kinds of digit sums, including those not divisible by 2019. But if ( a ) is large enough, the sequence can be sparse enough to avoid those numbers.Wait, but in the case ( a = 2019 ), the sequence can be constructed to include only numbers with digit sums divisible by 2019. So, perhaps the critical value is ( a = 2019 ). For ( a geq 2019 ), you can construct such a sequence, but for ( a < 2019 ), you can't.But the problem is asking for all ( a geq 1 ) such that for every sequence with ( a_n leq a n ), there are infinitely many terms with digit sums not divisible by 2019.So, if ( a geq 2019 ), then there exists a sequence (as shown) where all terms have digit sums divisible by 2019, which would mean that the condition is not satisfied. Therefore, such ( a ) do not satisfy the condition.On the other hand, if ( a < 2019 ), then perhaps in any sequence with ( a_n leq a n ), you can't avoid having infinitely many terms with digit sums not divisible by 2019.Wait, but how can I be sure? Maybe I need to use some theorem or principle.I recall that in combinatorics, there's a concept called the Erd≈ës theorem on arithmetic progressions, but I'm not sure if that applies here.Alternatively, perhaps I can use the concept of density again. If the sequence has density higher than the density of the set we're trying to avoid, then it must intersect it infinitely often.In our case, the set of numbers with digit sums not divisible by 2019 has density ( 1 - 1/2019 ). So, if the sequence has density ( 1/a ), and ( 1/a > 1 - 1/2019 ), which would mean ( a < 2019 / (2018/2019) ), but that seems complicated.Wait, maybe it's simpler. If the sequence has density ( 1/a ), and the set we're trying to avoid has density ( 1/2019 ), then if ( 1/a > 1/2019 ), meaning ( a < 2019 ), then the sequence is \\"dense\\" enough that it must intersect the complement set (digit sums not divisible by 2019) infinitely often.But I'm not sure if this is rigorous.Alternatively, perhaps I can use the concept of the natural density. If the natural density of the sequence is greater than the natural density of the set we're trying to avoid, then the intersection must have positive density.Wait, the natural density of the sequence is ( 1/a ), and the natural density of numbers with digit sums divisible by 2019 is ( 1/2019 ). So, if ( 1/a > 1/2019 ), meaning ( a < 2019 ), then the sequence must intersect the complement set (digit sums not divisible by 2019) with density at least ( 1/a - 1/2019 ), which is positive. Therefore, there are infinitely many terms in the sequence with digit sums not divisible by 2019.On the other hand, if ( a geq 2019 ), then the density of the sequence is ( leq 1/2019 ), so it's possible that the sequence is entirely contained within the set of numbers with digit sums divisible by 2019.Therefore, the critical value is ( a = 2019 ). So, for ( a < 2019 ), any sequence must have infinitely many terms with digit sums not divisible by 2019. For ( a geq 2019 ), you can construct a sequence where all terms have digit sums divisible by 2019, so the condition is not satisfied.Therefore, the answer should be all real numbers ( a ) such that ( 1 leq a < 2019 ).Wait, but let me double-check. If ( a = 2019 ), can we really construct a sequence where all terms have digit sums divisible by 2019?Yes, because for each ( n ), we can choose ( a_n ) to be a number ( leq 2019 n ) with digit sum divisible by 2019. Since the density of such numbers is ( 1/2019 ), and we're choosing one for each ( n ), it's possible.Therefore, for ( a = 2019 ), the condition is not satisfied because there exists a sequence where all terms have digit sums divisible by 2019.Hence, the set of ( a ) that satisfy the condition is ( 1 leq a < 2019 ).So, the final answer is all real numbers ( a ) with ( 1 leq a < 2019 ).**Final Answer**The real numbers ( a ) are all those satisfying ( 1 leq a < 2019 ). Thus, the answer is (boxed{2019}).Wait, hold on. The problem asks for all real numbers ( a geq 1 ) that satisfy the condition. So, the set is ( 1 leq a < 2019 ). But the answer should be in a box, and usually, such problems expect a specific value or interval. Since the critical value is 2019, and the answer is all ( a ) less than 2019, perhaps the answer is ( a < 2019 ), but since the problem specifies ( a geq 1 ), the interval is ( [1, 2019) ).But in the final answer, I wrote (boxed{2019}), which is the critical value. But actually, the answer is all ( a ) in ( [1, 2019) ). However, since the problem asks for all real numbers ( a geq 1 ) that satisfy the condition, and the condition is satisfied for ( a < 2019 ), perhaps the answer is that ( a ) must be less than 2019, so the supremum is 2019.But in the instructions, it says to put the final answer within boxed{}, so maybe I should write the interval. But I can't write an interval in a single box. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is that the minimal such ( a ) is 2019, but no, the condition is satisfied for ( a < 2019 ).Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again.If ( a ) is less than 2019, then any sequence with ( a_n leq a n ) must have infinitely many terms with digit sums not divisible by 2019. So, the set of ( a ) is ( [1, 2019) ).But the problem asks for all real numbers ( a geq 1 ) that satisfy the condition. So, the answer is all ( a ) in ( [1, 2019) ). But how to represent this in a box? Maybe as ( boxed{[1, 2019)} ).But I'm not sure if that's standard. Alternatively, since the critical value is 2019, and the answer is all ( a ) less than 2019, perhaps the answer is ( boxed{2019} ), indicating that ( a ) must be less than 2019.Wait, but in the problem statement, it's asking for all real numbers ( a geq 1 ) that satisfy the condition. So, the answer is the interval from 1 to 2019, not including 2019. So, in LaTeX, that's ( [1, 2019) ).But I'm not sure if the system accepts interval notation in the box. Maybe I should write it as ( boxed{[1, 2019)} ).Alternatively, if the answer is supposed to be a single number, perhaps 2019 is the threshold, so the answer is ( boxed{2019} ).But I think the correct answer is all ( a ) in ( [1, 2019) ), so I should write that in the box.**Final Answer**boxed{[1, 2019)}"},{"question":"Alex cycles 20 mph for 45 minutes and then three times as long for one and a half times the speed. How far did she cycle in total?","answer":"First, I need to determine the distance Alex covered during the first part of her ride. She was cycling at a speed of 20 mph for 45 minutes. Since time is in minutes, I'll convert it to hours by dividing by 60, which gives 0.75 hours. Then, I'll multiply the speed by the time to find the distance: 20 mph * 0.75 hours = 15 miles.Next, for the second part of the ride, Alex cycles three times as long as the first part.

Her school is 2 blocks east and 2 blocks north of the northeast corner of City Park.

If her route is as short as possible, how many different routes can she take?textbf{(A)} 3 qquad textbf{(B)} 6 qquad textbf{(C)} 9 qquad textbf{(D)} 12 qquad textbf{(E)} 18","answer":"Okay, so I need to figure out how many different routes Samantha can take to school, making sure her route is as short as possible. Let me try to visualize the problem first.Samantha lives 2 blocks west and 1 block south of the southwest corner of City Park. So, if I imagine the southwest corner as a point, her home is 2 blocks west and 1 block south from there. That means she has to go east 2 blocks and north 1 block to get to the southwest corner.Her school is 2 blocks east and 2 blocks north of the northeast corner of City Park. Hmm, so the northeast corner is diagonally opposite the southwest corner, right? So, the school is 2 blocks east and 2 blocks north from that northeast corner. That means from the northeast corner, she needs to go east 2 blocks and north 2 blocks to get to school.On school days, she bikes on streets to the southwest corner, then takes a diagonal path through the park to the northeast corner, and then bikes on streets to school. So, her route is divided into three parts: from home to southwest corner, then through the park diagonally to the northeast corner, and then from there to school.But the problem says her route is as short as possible. So, I need to figure out the number of different shortest routes she can take. Since she's moving on a grid, the number of routes is a combinatorial problem.Let me break it down into segments.First segment: From home to southwest corner.She is 2 blocks west and 1 block south of the southwest corner. So, to get to the southwest corner, she needs to go east 2 blocks and north 1 block. Since she can only bike on streets, she can only move east or north. So, how many different ways can she go from her home to the southwest corner?This is a classic combination problem. She needs to make a total of 2 east moves and 1 north move, in any order. The number of different routes is the number of ways to arrange these moves.The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of moves, and k is the number of moves in one direction.Here, total moves = 2 east + 1 north = 3 moves.Number of different routes = C(3, 2) = 3! / (2!1!) = 6 / 2 = 3.Alternatively, it's the same as C(3,1) since choosing where to go north among the 3 moves. Either way, it's 3 routes.Okay, so first segment has 3 possible routes.Second segment: From southwest corner to northeast corner through the park diagonally.Wait, the problem says she takes a diagonal path through the park. So, is this a straight line, or is it a path that's equivalent to moving east and north? Hmm, the problem says she takes a diagonal path, so maybe this is considered a single move, not broken down into blocks. So, perhaps this segment doesn't contribute to the number of different routes because it's just one path.But wait, the problem is asking for the total number of different routes she can take, considering all segments. So, if the diagonal path is fixed, then this segment doesn't add any variability. So, the number of different routes is determined only by the first and third segments.Third segment: From northeast corner to school.The school is 2 blocks east and 2 blocks north of the northeast corner. So, from the northeast corner, she needs to go east 2 blocks and north 2 blocks. Again, she can only move east or north on the streets.So, how many different routes are there from northeast corner to school?This is another combination problem. She needs to make 2 east moves and 2 north moves, in any order. The number of different routes is C(4,2) = 6.Because total moves = 4, choosing 2 to be east (or north). So, 4! / (2!2!) = 24 / 4 = 6.So, third segment has 6 possible routes.Now, since the second segment is a fixed diagonal path, the total number of different routes is the product of the number of routes for the first segment and the third segment.So, total routes = 3 (first segment) * 6 (third segment) = 18.Wait, but the answer choices are 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, with E being 18. So, is 18 the answer? Hmm, but let me double-check.Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The problem says she goes from home to southwest corner, then diagonally to northeast corner, then to school. So, the diagonal path is fixed, so only the first and third segments contribute to the number of different routes.First segment: 3 routes.Third segment: 6 routes.Total routes: 3 * 6 = 18.But wait, the answer choices include 18 as option E. So, is it 18? Hmm.Wait, but let me think again. Maybe the diagonal path is not fixed. Maybe the park allows for different diagonal paths, but the problem says she takes a diagonal path through the park. So, is that considered one specific path, or multiple paths?Wait, the problem says she takes a diagonal path, but it doesn't specify if there are multiple diagonal paths or just one. So, perhaps it's considered as one path, meaning that the number of different routes is just the product of the first and third segments.Alternatively, maybe the diagonal path is considered as a single move, but in terms of blocks, how many blocks is that? Wait, the southwest corner to northeast corner is... If the park is a rectangle, then from southwest to northeast corner, it's the diagonal, which would be equivalent to moving east and north. But since she's taking a diagonal path, maybe it's considered as moving east and north simultaneously, but in terms of blocks, it's the same as moving east and north.Wait, but in terms of the grid, if she goes from southwest corner to northeast corner, that would require moving east and north. But if she takes a diagonal path, maybe it's equivalent to moving in a straight line, which would be shorter than going along the streets. But since the problem says her route is as short as possible, maybe the diagonal path is the shortest way through the park.But in terms of counting the number of routes, if the diagonal is considered as a single step, then the number of routes would be the product of the first and third segments.Alternatively, maybe the diagonal path is not considered as a single step, but rather, she can choose different diagonal paths, which might correspond to different numbers of east and north moves.Wait, no, because the diagonal path is through the park, which is a straight line, so it's not on the grid. So, she can't make different diagonal paths; it's just one path. So, the number of different routes is just the number of ways to get to the southwest corner times the number of ways to get from the northeast corner to school.So, 3 * 6 = 18.But wait, the answer choices include 18, which is E. But let me check the problem again.Wait, the problem says \\"on school days she bikes on streets to the southwest corner of City Park, then takes a diagonal path through the park to the northeast corner, and then bikes on streets to school.\\" So, the diagonal path is fixed, so it's just one way to go from southwest to northeast corner.Therefore, the number of different routes is the number of ways from home to southwest corner multiplied by the number of ways from northeast corner to school.So, 3 * 6 = 18.But wait, the answer choices are A)3, B)6, C)9, D)12, E)18.So, 18 is an option, E. So, is that the answer?Wait, but let me think again. Maybe I'm miscounting the number of moves.First segment: From home to southwest corner.She is 2 blocks west and 1 block south. So, to get to southwest corner, she needs to go east 2 and north 1.Number of routes: C(3,2) = 3.Third segment: From northeast corner to school.School is 2 east and 2 north from northeast corner. So, she needs to go east 2 and north 2.Number of routes: C(4,2) = 6.So, total routes: 3 * 6 = 18.Yes, that seems correct.But wait, the answer choices include 18, but the options are A)3, B)6, C)9, D)12, E)18.So, 18 is E.But wait, let me think if there's another way to interpret the problem.Is the diagonal path through the park considered as a single block or multiple blocks? If it's considered as a single block, then the total path would be home -> southwest corner (3 routes) -> northeast corner (1 route) -> school (6 routes). So, total routes: 3 * 1 * 6 = 18.Alternatively, if the diagonal path is considered as moving through the park, which might involve some grid-like paths, but the problem says it's a diagonal path, so it's likely a straight line, not along the grid.Therefore, the number of different routes is 18.But wait, the answer choices include 18, but the problem is from an AMC test, and sometimes the answer might not be as straightforward. Let me see if I can find another way.Wait, maybe the diagonal path is actually equivalent to moving east and north in some way, but in the park, so perhaps it's considered as a single move, but in terms of blocks, it's the same as moving east and north.Wait, but no, because the diagonal path is through the park, which is a straight line, so it's not on the grid. So, it's just one path.Alternatively, maybe the park is a grid, and the diagonal path is moving through the park's grid diagonally, but that would complicate things.Wait, no, the problem says she takes a diagonal path through the park, so it's a straight line, not along the streets. So, it's just one way to go from southwest corner to northeast corner.Therefore, the number of different routes is 3 * 6 = 18.But wait, the answer choices include 18, so that must be the answer.Wait, but let me check the problem again.\\"Samantha lives 2 blocks west and 1 block south of the southwest corner of City Park. Her school is 2 blocks east and 2 blocks north of the northeast corner of City Park. On school days she bikes on streets to the southwest corner of City Park, then takes a diagonal path through the park to the northeast corner, and then bikes on streets to school. If her route is as short as possible, how many different routes can she take?\\"So, the key is that the entire route is as short as possible. So, she must take the shortest path from home to school, which involves going to the southwest corner, then diagonally to the northeast corner, then to school.But is the diagonal path the shortest way from southwest to northeast corner? Or is there a shorter way?Wait, if she goes from southwest corner to northeast corner through the park diagonally, that's the straight line distance, which is shorter than going around the park on the streets.But in terms of blocks, how many blocks is that diagonal? If the park is a rectangle, then the diagonal would be sqrt((east blocks)^2 + (north blocks)^2). But in terms of city blocks, it's not a grid, so the distance is less, but in terms of counting routes, it's just one path.But in terms of the number of blocks she travels, the diagonal is shorter, but in terms of counting the number of different routes, it's just one segment.Therefore, the number of different routes is the product of the number of ways to get to the southwest corner and the number of ways to get from the northeast corner to school.So, 3 * 6 = 18.Therefore, the answer is E) 18.But wait, I'm a bit confused because the answer choices don't have 18 as the first option, but it's the last one. Maybe I made a mistake.Wait, let me think again.First segment: From home to southwest corner.She needs to go east 2, north 1. So, number of routes: C(3,2) = 3.Third segment: From northeast corner to school.She needs to go east 2, north 2. So, number of routes: C(4,2) = 6.Total routes: 3 * 6 = 18.Yes, that seems correct.Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the entire route from home to school, including the diagonal, as a single path, but the diagonal is fixed, so the number of different routes is just the product of the first and third segments.Therefore, the answer is 18.Wait, but let me think if the diagonal path affects the number of routes. If the diagonal path is considered as a single move, then the total number of moves is 3 (first segment) + 1 (diagonal) + 4 (third segment) = 8 moves, but that doesn't make sense because the diagonal is a straight line, not a series of moves.Alternatively, maybe the diagonal path is equivalent to moving east and north in some way, but it's a straight line, so it's just one path.Therefore, the number of different routes is 3 * 6 = 18.Yes, I think that's correct.**Final Answer**boxed{E}"},{"question":"There are six oranges in a fruit basket. There are two fewer apples than oranges.  There are 3 times as many bananas as apples, and there are half as many peaches as bananas.  How many pieces of fruit are in the fruit basket?","answer":"First, I note that there are 6 oranges in the basket.Since there are two fewer apples than oranges, the number of apples is 6 minus 2, which equals 4 apples.Next, there are 3 times as many bananas as apples. Therefore, the number of bananas is 3 multiplied by 4, resulting in 12 bananas.There are half as many peaches as bananas. This means the number of peaches is 12 divided by 2, which is 6 peaches.Finally, to find the total number of pieces of fruit, I add up the oranges, apples, bananas, and peaches: 6 + 4 + 12 + 6, which equals 28 pieces of fruit."},{"question":"If the integer part of sqrt{13} is a and the decimal part is b, find the value of a^{2}+b-sqrt{13}.","answer":"First, I need to determine the integer part ( a ) of ( sqrt{13} ).

Since she burns 2 pounds per hour, jogging for 1.5 hours daily means she burns 3 pounds each day.Next, I'll calculate the total weight loss over the three weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so over three weeks, there are 21 days. Burning 3 pounds each day for 21 days results in a total weight loss of 63 pounds.Now, I'll convert Maya's initial weight from kilograms to pounds.

Hmm, let me try to understand what this means.First, let me recall what the intersection of two sets is. The intersection is a set containing all elements that are common to both sets. So, in this case, the intersection of {a¬≤ - 1, 2} and {1, 2, 3, 2a - 4} is {a - 2}. That means that the only element common to both sets is a - 2.So, let me write down the two sets:Set A: {a¬≤ - 1, 2}Set B: {1, 2, 3, 2a - 4}Their intersection is {a - 2}, so a - 2 must be an element of both Set A and Set B.Therefore, a - 2 must be equal to one of the elements in Set A, which are a¬≤ - 1 and 2. Similarly, a - 2 must also be equal to one of the elements in Set B, which are 1, 2, 3, and 2a - 4.So, let me break this down into two parts:1. a - 2 is in Set A: So, either a - 2 = a¬≤ - 1 or a - 2 = 2.2. a - 2 is in Set B: So, either a - 2 = 1, a - 2 = 2, a - 2 = 3, or a - 2 = 2a - 4.I need to solve these equations and find the value of a that satisfies both conditions.Let me start with the first part: a - 2 is in Set A.Case 1: a - 2 = a¬≤ - 1Let me solve this equation:a - 2 = a¬≤ - 1Bring all terms to one side:a¬≤ - a - 1 + 2 = 0Simplify:a¬≤ - a + 1 = 0Wait, that's a quadratic equation. Let me compute the discriminant to see if there are real solutions.Discriminant D = (-1)¬≤ - 4 * 1 * 1 = 1 - 4 = -3Since the discriminant is negative, there are no real solutions for this case. So, this case doesn't give us a valid value for a.Case 2: a - 2 = 2Solving for a:a - 2 = 2Add 2 to both sides:a = 4Okay, so a = 4 is a possible solution. Let me note that down.Now, moving on to the second part: a - 2 is in Set B.So, a - 2 must be equal to one of the elements in Set B: 1, 2, 3, or 2a - 4.So, let me consider each possibility:Subcase 1: a - 2 = 1Solving for a:a - 2 = 1Add 2 to both sides:a = 3Subcase 2: a - 2 = 2Solving for a:a - 2 = 2Add 2 to both sides:a = 4Subcase 3: a - 2 = 3Solving for a:a - 2 = 3Add 2 to both sides:a = 5Subcase 4: a - 2 = 2a - 4Solving for a:a - 2 = 2a - 4Subtract a from both sides:-2 = a - 4Add 4 to both sides:2 = aSo, a = 2So, from the second part, the possible solutions are a = 3, 4, 5, or 2.But from the first part, the only possible solution is a = 4.Therefore, the value of a must satisfy both parts, so a must be 4.But wait, let me verify this because sometimes when dealing with sets, there might be other constraints.Let me substitute a = 4 into both sets and check if the intersection is indeed {a - 2}.First, compute Set A when a = 4:Set A: {a¬≤ - 1, 2} = {16 - 1, 2} = {15, 2}Set B: {1, 2, 3, 2a - 4} = {1, 2, 3, 8 - 4} = {1, 2, 3, 4}So, the intersection of {15, 2} and {1, 2, 3, 4} is {2}.But according to the problem, the intersection should be {a - 2} = {4 - 2} = {2}.So, that works. The intersection is {2}, which is equal to {a - 2} when a = 4.Wait, but let me check if a = 4 is the only solution.Looking back, in the first part, when a - 2 is in Set A, we only got a = 4 as a solution because the other case had no real solutions.In the second part, a - 2 is in Set B, which gave us a = 3, 4, 5, or 2. But only a = 4 is common to both parts.But just to be thorough, let me check the other possible values from the second part to see if they could also satisfy the first part, even if they don't seem to.Let's check a = 3:From the first part, a - 2 = 1. Is 1 in Set A?Set A when a = 3: {9 - 1, 2} = {8, 2}. So, 1 is not in Set A. Therefore, a = 3 is invalid.Similarly, a = 5:a - 2 = 3. Is 3 in Set A?Set A when a = 5: {25 - 1, 2} = {24, 2}. 3 is not in Set A. So, a = 5 is invalid.a = 2:a - 2 = 0. Is 0 in Set A?Set A when a = 2: {4 - 1, 2} = {3, 2}. 0 is not in Set A. So, a = 2 is invalid.Therefore, only a = 4 is valid.Wait, but let me think again. The problem states that the intersection is {a - 2}. So, the intersection is a singleton set containing a - 2. That means that a - 2 must be the only common element between the two sets.So, in addition to a - 2 being in both sets, we must ensure that no other elements are common between the two sets.So, for a = 4, Set A is {15, 2}, Set B is {1, 2, 3, 4}. The intersection is {2}, which is equal to {a - 2} because a - 2 = 2. So, that's correct.But let me check if for a = 4, is there any other common element besides 2? Set A is {15, 2}, Set B is {1, 2, 3, 4}. The only common element is 2, so that's good.But let me check for a = 3, even though a - 2 = 1 is not in Set A, but just to see:Set A: {8, 2}, Set B: {1, 2, 3, 2}. Wait, 2 is in both sets, so the intersection would be {2}, but a - 2 = 1, which is not equal to 2. So, the intersection is {2}, but the problem says it should be {a - 2} = {1}, which is not the case. So, that's why a = 3 is invalid.Similarly, for a = 5:Set A: {24, 2}, Set B: {1, 2, 3, 6}. The intersection is {2}, but a - 2 = 3, so the intersection should be {3}, but it's {2}, so that's invalid.For a = 2:Set A: {3, 2}, Set B: {1, 2, 3, 0}. The intersection is {2, 3}, but a - 2 = 0, so the intersection should be {0}, but it's {2, 3}, which is invalid.Therefore, only a = 4 satisfies the condition that the intersection is exactly {a - 2}.Wait, another thought: when a = 4, Set A is {15, 2}, Set B is {1, 2, 3, 4}. So, the intersection is {2}, which is equal to {a - 2} because a - 2 = 2. So, that's correct.But let me check if there are any other possible a's that could satisfy both parts.Wait, in the first part, when we considered a - 2 being in Set A, we had two cases: a - 2 = a¬≤ - 1 and a - 2 = 2.We saw that the first case had no real solutions, so only a = 4 was a solution.But just to be thorough, let me consider if a - 2 could be equal to both elements in Set A, but that would require a - 2 = a¬≤ - 1 and a - 2 = 2 at the same time, which is impossible because a can't satisfy both equations unless a¬≤ - 1 = 2, which would mean a¬≤ = 3, so a = sqrt(3) or -sqrt(3). But then, a - 2 would have to be equal to 2, so a = 4, which doesn't satisfy a¬≤ = 3. So, that's not possible.Therefore, the only solution is a = 4.Wait, but let me think again about the intersection. The problem says the intersection is {a - 2}, which is a set containing one element. So, the intersection must have exactly one element, which is a - 2.So, in addition to a - 2 being in both sets, we must ensure that no other elements are common between the two sets.So, for a = 4, Set A is {15, 2}, Set B is {1, 2, 3, 4}. The intersection is {2}, which is equal to {a - 2} = {2}. So, that's good.But let me check if for a = 4, is there any other element in common besides 2? Set A has 15 and 2, Set B has 1, 2, 3, 4. So, no, only 2 is common. So, that's correct.But let me check for a = 3 again, just to be thorough. Set A would be {8, 2}, Set B would be {1, 2, 3, 2}. Wait, 2 is in both sets, so the intersection is {2}, but a - 2 = 1, so the intersection should be {1}, but it's {2}, so that's invalid.Similarly, for a = 5, Set A is {24, 2}, Set B is {1, 2, 3, 6}. The intersection is {2}, but a - 2 = 3, so the intersection should be {3}, but it's {2}, so that's invalid.For a = 2, Set A is {3, 2}, Set B is {1, 2, 3, 0}. The intersection is {2, 3}, but a - 2 = 0, so the intersection should be {0}, but it's {2, 3}, which is invalid.Therefore, only a = 4 is valid.Wait, another thought: could a - 2 be equal to 2a - 4? Because in the second part, one of the possibilities is a - 2 = 2a - 4, which gives a = 2. But when a = 2, as we saw earlier, the intersection is {2, 3}, which is not equal to {0}, so that's invalid. So, even though a = 2 satisfies a - 2 = 2a - 4, it doesn't satisfy the overall condition because the intersection is not {a - 2}.Therefore, a = 4 is the only solution.Wait, but let me double-check the equations again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.From the first part:a - 2 is in Set A, which is {a¬≤ - 1, 2}So, either a - 2 = a¬≤ - 1 or a - 2 = 2.Case 1: a - 2 = a¬≤ - 1Which simplifies to a¬≤ - a - 1 + 2 = 0 => a¬≤ - a + 1 = 0Discriminant: (-1)^2 - 4*1*1 = 1 - 4 = -3 < 0, so no real solutions.Case 2: a - 2 = 2 => a = 4From the second part:a - 2 is in Set B, which is {1, 2, 3, 2a - 4}So, a - 2 must be equal to one of these elements.So, a - 2 = 1 => a = 3a - 2 = 2 => a = 4a - 2 = 3 => a = 5a - 2 = 2a - 4 => a = 2So, possible a's are 3,4,5,2.But only a = 4 is common to both parts.Therefore, a = 4 is the solution.I think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'm confident that a = 4 is the correct answer."},{"question":"Given that the base ( BC ) and the height ( AD ) of an isosceles triangle ( triangle ABC ) are both integers, then among (sin A) and (cos A):A. One is a rational number, and the other is an irrational number.B. Both are rational numbers.C. Both are irrational numbers.D. Whether they are rational or irrational depends on the values of ( BD ) and ( AC ).","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about an isosceles triangle ABC where the base BC and the height AD are both integers. I need to figure out whether sin A and cos A are rational, irrational, or a mix. The options are A, B, C, D as given.First, let me visualize the triangle. Since it's isosceles with base BC, that means sides AB and AC are equal. The height AD is drawn from vertex A perpendicular to base BC, splitting it into two equal parts, BD and DC. So BD = DC = BC/2.Given that BC and AD are integers, let me denote BC as 2k (since it's split into two equal integer parts, k must be an integer). So BD = k, and AD = h, where h is also an integer.Now, triangle ABD is a right-angled triangle with sides BD = k, AD = h, and hypotenuse AB. Since AB is equal to AC, it's the equal side of the isosceles triangle.Using the Pythagorean theorem, AB¬≤ = BD¬≤ + AD¬≤, so AB¬≤ = k¬≤ + h¬≤.Therefore, AB = sqrt(k¬≤ + h¬≤). Since AB is a side of the triangle, it must be a positive real number, but it doesn't necessarily have to be an integer unless k¬≤ + h¬≤ is a perfect square.Now, angle A is the vertex angle of the isosceles triangle. So in triangle ABC, angle A is at the top, and BC is the base.I need to find sin A and cos A. Let me recall that in triangle ABC, angle A is opposite side BC, and sides AB and AC are equal.Wait, but actually, in triangle ABC, angle A is between sides AB and AC, which are equal. So, to find sin A and cos A, I might need to use the Law of Cosines or maybe some trigonometric identities.Alternatively, since I have the height AD, which is h, and the base BC, which is 2k, I can express sin A and cos A in terms of h and k.Let me think about triangle ABD. It's a right triangle with legs k and h, and hypotenuse sqrt(k¬≤ + h¬≤). The angle at A in triangle ABD is half of angle A in triangle ABC because the height AD splits angle A into two equal angles.Wait, no. Actually, in triangle ABC, the height AD splits it into two congruent right triangles, each with angle at D. The angle at A in triangle ABC is the angle between sides AB and AC, which is the same as the angle between the two equal sides.But in triangle ABD, the angle at A is actually half of angle A in triangle ABC because AD is the height and splits angle A into two equal parts. So, if I denote angle BAD as Œ∏, then angle BAC (which is angle A) is 2Œ∏.So, in triangle ABD, angle BAD is Œ∏, with opposite side BD = k, adjacent side AD = h, and hypotenuse AB = sqrt(k¬≤ + h¬≤).Therefore, sin Œ∏ = opposite/hypotenuse = k / sqrt(k¬≤ + h¬≤)Similarly, cos Œ∏ = adjacent/hypotenuse = h / sqrt(k¬≤ + h¬≤)But angle A is 2Œ∏, so I can use double-angle formulas to find sin A and cos A.Recall that sin(2Œ∏) = 2 sin Œ∏ cos Œ∏And cos(2Œ∏) = cos¬≤Œ∏ - sin¬≤Œ∏So, let's compute sin A and cos A.First, sin A = sin(2Œ∏) = 2 sin Œ∏ cos Œ∏ = 2*(k / sqrt(k¬≤ + h¬≤))*(h / sqrt(k¬≤ + h¬≤)) = 2kh / (k¬≤ + h¬≤)Similarly, cos A = cos(2Œ∏) = cos¬≤Œ∏ - sin¬≤Œ∏ = (h¬≤ / (k¬≤ + h¬≤)) - (k¬≤ / (k¬≤ + h¬≤)) = (h¬≤ - k¬≤) / (k¬≤ + h¬≤)So, sin A = 2kh / (k¬≤ + h¬≤) and cos A = (h¬≤ - k¬≤) / (k¬≤ + h¬≤)Now, both sin A and cos A are expressed in terms of integers k and h, since BC = 2k and AD = h are both integers.So, sin A is 2kh divided by (k¬≤ + h¬≤), and cos A is (h¬≤ - k¬≤) divided by (k¬≤ + h¬≤). Both denominators are the same, which is k¬≤ + h¬≤.Now, the question is whether sin A and cos A are rational or irrational.Given that k and h are integers, the numerator and denominator of sin A and cos A are both integers. So, sin A and cos A are both rational numbers if and only if 2kh and (h¬≤ - k¬≤) are integers, which they are, but more importantly, whether the fractions reduce to rational numbers.Wait, but any fraction of integers is a rational number, provided that the denominator is not zero, which it isn't here because k and h are positive integers.Therefore, sin A and cos A are both rational numbers because they are expressed as ratios of integers.But wait, hold on. Let me think again. If k and h are integers, then 2kh and (h¬≤ - k¬≤) are integers, and k¬≤ + h¬≤ is also an integer. So, sin A and cos A are both rational numbers because they are expressed as the ratio of two integers.Therefore, both sin A and cos A are rational numbers. So, the answer should be option B.Wait, but let me test this with an example to make sure.Let me take a specific case where BC = 2k = 2, so k = 1, and AD = h = 1. Then, AB = sqrt(1 + 1) = sqrt(2). So, sin A = 2*1*1 / (1 + 1) = 2/2 = 1, which is rational. Cos A = (1 - 1)/2 = 0, which is also rational.Another example: BC = 4, so k = 2, and AD = 3, h = 3. Then AB = sqrt(4 + 9) = sqrt(13). Then sin A = 2*2*3 / (4 + 9) = 12/13, which is rational. Cos A = (9 - 4)/13 = 5/13, also rational.Another example: BC = 6, k = 3, AD = 4, h = 4. AB = 5. Then sin A = 2*3*4 / (9 + 16) = 24/25, rational. Cos A = (16 - 9)/25 = 7/25, rational.Wait, so in all these cases, sin A and cos A are rational. So, seems like option B is correct.But wait, let me try another example where maybe the triangle is such that k¬≤ + h¬≤ is not a perfect square.Let me take BC = 2, k = 1, AD = 2, h = 2. Then AB = sqrt(1 + 4) = sqrt(5). Then sin A = 2*1*2 / (1 + 4) = 4/5, which is rational. Cos A = (4 - 1)/5 = 3/5, also rational.Wait, so even if AB is irrational, sin A and cos A are still rational because they are expressed as fractions of integers.So, regardless of whether AB is rational or not, sin A and cos A are rational because they are expressed as ratios of integers.Therefore, in all cases, sin A and cos A are rational numbers.So, the correct answer is B: Both are rational numbers.**Final Answer**boxed{B}"},{"question":"Given the point M(-1,1) and the parabola C: y^2 = 4x, find the slope k of the line passing through the focus of C and intersecting C at points A and B. If angle AMB = 90^circ, then the value of k is ______.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the slope ( k ) of a line that passes through the focus of the parabola ( C: y^2 = 4x ) and intersects the parabola at points ( A ) and ( B ). Additionally, the angle ( angle AMB ) is 90 degrees, where ( M ) is the point ( (-1, 1) ). Hmm, that seems a bit complex, but let's break it down step by step.First, I remember that the standard form of a parabola that opens to the right is ( y^2 = 4ax ), where ( a ) is the distance from the vertex to the focus. In this case, comparing ( y^2 = 4x ) to the standard form, it looks like ( 4a = 4 ), so ( a = 1 ). Therefore, the focus of the parabola ( C ) is at ( (1, 0) ). Got that down.Now, the problem says the line passes through the focus, which is ( (1, 0) ), and has a slope ( k ). So, the equation of this line should be something like ( y = k(x - 1) ), right? Because it passes through ( (1, 0) ), so using point-slope form, ( y - 0 = k(x - 1) ), simplifying to ( y = kx - k ). Okay, that makes sense.Next, this line intersects the parabola ( C ) at points ( A ) and ( B ). So, to find the coordinates of ( A ) and ( B ), I need to solve the system of equations consisting of the parabola and the line. Let me write that down:1. ( y^2 = 4x )2. ( y = kx - k )I can substitute equation 2 into equation 1 to eliminate ( y ). Let's do that:( (kx - k)^2 = 4x )Expanding the left side:( (kx - k)^2 = (k(x - 1))^2 = k^2(x - 1)^2 = k^2(x^2 - 2x + 1) )So, substituting back:( k^2(x^2 - 2x + 1) = 4x )Let me write this as a quadratic in ( x ):( k^2x^2 - 2k^2x + k^2 - 4x = 0 )Hmm, let's combine like terms:The ( x^2 ) term: ( k^2x^2 )The ( x ) terms: ( -2k^2x - 4x = (-2k^2 - 4)x )The constant term: ( k^2 )So, the quadratic equation is:( k^2x^2 - (2k^2 + 4)x + k^2 = 0 )Let me write this as:( k^2x^2 - (2k^2 + 4)x + k^2 = 0 )This is a quadratic in ( x ), so let's denote it as ( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 ), where:- ( a = k^2 )- ( b = -(2k^2 + 4) )- ( c = k^2 )Now, the solutions to this quadratic will give me the x-coordinates of points ( A ) and ( B ). Let me denote the roots as ( x_1 ) and ( x_2 ). From quadratic theory, I know that:( x_1 + x_2 = -b/a = (2k^2 + 4)/k^2 )and( x_1x_2 = c/a = k^2/k^2 = 1 )So, the product of the roots is 1, and the sum is ( (2k^2 + 4)/k^2 ). Hmm, that might be useful later.Now, since points ( A ) and ( B ) lie on both the parabola and the line, their coordinates can be written as ( (x_1, y_1) ) and ( (x_2, y_2) ), where ( y_1 = kx_1 - k ) and ( y_2 = kx_2 - k ).The next part of the problem states that ( angle AMB = 90^circ ). So, triangle ( AMB ) is right-angled at ( M ). I need to translate this geometric condition into an algebraic equation.I remember that if two lines are perpendicular, the product of their slopes is ( -1 ). So, if ( angle AMB = 90^circ ), then the lines ( MA ) and ( MB ) are perpendicular. Therefore, the product of their slopes should be ( -1 ).Let me find the slopes of ( MA ) and ( MB ). The slope of ( MA ) is ( (y_1 - 1)/(x_1 + 1) ), since ( M ) is at ( (-1, 1) ). Similarly, the slope of ( MB ) is ( (y_2 - 1)/(x_2 + 1) ).So, the product of these slopes should be ( -1 ):( left( frac{y_1 - 1}{x_1 + 1} right) left( frac{y_2 - 1}{x_2 + 1} right) = -1 )Let me write that equation:( frac{(y_1 - 1)(y_2 - 1)}{(x_1 + 1)(x_2 + 1)} = -1 )So, cross-multiplying:( (y_1 - 1)(y_2 - 1) = - (x_1 + 1)(x_2 + 1) )That's the equation I need to work with. Now, let's express ( y_1 ) and ( y_2 ) in terms of ( x_1 ) and ( x_2 ). From earlier, we have:( y_1 = kx_1 - k )( y_2 = kx_2 - k )So, substituting these into the equation:( (kx_1 - k - 1)(kx_2 - k - 1) = - (x_1 + 1)(x_2 + 1) )Let me simplify the left side:First, factor out ( k ) from the first two terms:( (k(x_1 - 1) - 1)(k(x_2 - 1) - 1) )Let me denote ( a = x_1 - 1 ) and ( b = x_2 - 1 ), just to make it easier to write:( (ka - 1)(kb - 1) )Expanding this:( k^2ab - ka - kb + 1 )So, substituting back ( a = x_1 - 1 ) and ( b = x_2 - 1 ):( k^2(x_1 - 1)(x_2 - 1) - k(x_1 - 1) - k(x_2 - 1) + 1 )Now, let's compute each term:1. ( k^2(x_1 - 1)(x_2 - 1) )2. ( -k(x_1 - 1) )3. ( -k(x_2 - 1) )4. ( +1 )Let me compute each part step by step.First, let's compute ( (x_1 - 1)(x_2 - 1) ):( (x_1 - 1)(x_2 - 1) = x_1x_2 - x_1 - x_2 + 1 )We already know from earlier that ( x_1x_2 = 1 ) and ( x_1 + x_2 = (2k^2 + 4)/k^2 ). So, substituting these:( (x_1 - 1)(x_2 - 1) = 1 - (x_1 + x_2) + 1 = 2 - (x_1 + x_2) )But ( x_1 + x_2 = (2k^2 + 4)/k^2 ), so:( (x_1 - 1)(x_2 - 1) = 2 - frac{2k^2 + 4}{k^2} = 2 - 2 - frac{4}{k^2} = - frac{4}{k^2} )Okay, so the first term becomes:( k^2 times left( - frac{4}{k^2} right) = -4 )Now, the second term is ( -k(x_1 - 1) ). Let's compute ( x_1 - 1 ):( x_1 - 1 = x_1 - 1 ). Hmm, not much to do here. Similarly, ( x_2 - 1 = x_2 - 1 ). So, the second and third terms:( -k(x_1 - 1) - k(x_2 - 1) = -k(x_1 + x_2 - 2) )We know ( x_1 + x_2 = (2k^2 + 4)/k^2 ), so:( -kleft( frac{2k^2 + 4}{k^2} - 2 right) )Simplify inside the brackets:( frac{2k^2 + 4}{k^2} - 2 = frac{2k^2 + 4 - 2k^2}{k^2} = frac{4}{k^2} )So, the second and third terms together:( -k times frac{4}{k^2} = - frac{4}{k} )Therefore, putting it all together, the left side:( -4 - frac{4}{k} + 1 = (-4 + 1) - frac{4}{k} = -3 - frac{4}{k} )Now, the right side of the equation is:( - (x_1 + 1)(x_2 + 1) )Let me compute ( (x_1 + 1)(x_2 + 1) ):( x_1x_2 + x_1 + x_2 + 1 )Again, substituting known values:( x_1x_2 = 1 )( x_1 + x_2 = frac{2k^2 + 4}{k^2} )So,( (x_1 + 1)(x_2 + 1) = 1 + frac{2k^2 + 4}{k^2} + 1 = 2 + frac{2k^2 + 4}{k^2} )Simplify:( 2 + frac{2k^2}{k^2} + frac{4}{k^2} = 2 + 2 + frac{4}{k^2} = 4 + frac{4}{k^2} )Therefore, the right side is:( - left( 4 + frac{4}{k^2} right ) = -4 - frac{4}{k^2} )So, putting it all together, the equation we have is:Left side: ( -3 - frac{4}{k} )Right side: ( -4 - frac{4}{k^2} )So, setting them equal:( -3 - frac{4}{k} = -4 - frac{4}{k^2} )Let me bring all terms to one side:( -3 - frac{4}{k} + 4 + frac{4}{k^2} = 0 )Simplify:( 1 - frac{4}{k} + frac{4}{k^2} = 0 )Hmm, that's a quadratic in terms of ( 1/k ). Let me let ( u = 1/k ), so the equation becomes:( 1 - 4u + 4u^2 = 0 )Which is:( 4u^2 - 4u + 1 = 0 )Let me solve this quadratic equation for ( u ):Using the quadratic formula:( u = frac{4 pm sqrt{(4)^2 - 4 times 4 times 1}}{2 times 4} = frac{4 pm sqrt{16 - 16}}{8} = frac{4 pm 0}{8} = frac{4}{8} = frac{1}{2} )So, ( u = frac{1}{2} ). But ( u = 1/k ), so ( 1/k = 1/2 ), which means ( k = 2 ).Wait, but hold on. The quadratic equation had a discriminant of zero, so only one solution, ( u = 1/2 ), so only one value for ( k ), which is 2. Hmm, is that the only solution?Wait, let me double-check my steps because sometimes when dealing with quadratics, especially after substitutions, it's easy to make a mistake.So, starting from:( -3 - frac{4}{k} = -4 - frac{4}{k^2} )Adding 4 to both sides:( 1 - frac{4}{k} = - frac{4}{k^2} )Then, adding ( frac{4}{k^2} ) to both sides:( 1 - frac{4}{k} + frac{4}{k^2} = 0 )Which is the same as:( frac{4}{k^2} - frac{4}{k} + 1 = 0 )Multiply both sides by ( k^2 ) to eliminate denominators:( 4 - 4k + k^2 = 0 )Which is:( k^2 - 4k + 4 = 0 )This factors as:( (k - 2)^2 = 0 )So, ( k = 2 ) is the only solution. So, that seems correct.Wait, but just to make sure, let's verify if this actually satisfies the original condition.So, if ( k = 2 ), then the equation of the line is ( y = 2x - 2 ).Let me find points ( A ) and ( B ) by solving the system:1. ( y^2 = 4x )2. ( y = 2x - 2 )Substitute equation 2 into equation 1:( (2x - 2)^2 = 4x )Expanding:( 4x^2 - 8x + 4 = 4x )Bring all terms to one side:( 4x^2 - 12x + 4 = 0 )Divide by 4:( x^2 - 3x + 1 = 0 )Solutions:( x = frac{3 pm sqrt{9 - 4}}{2} = frac{3 pm sqrt{5}}{2} )So, ( x_1 = frac{3 + sqrt{5}}{2} ), ( x_2 = frac{3 - sqrt{5}}{2} )Then, ( y_1 = 2x_1 - 2 = 2 times frac{3 + sqrt{5}}{2} - 2 = 3 + sqrt{5} - 2 = 1 + sqrt{5} )Similarly, ( y_2 = 2x_2 - 2 = 2 times frac{3 - sqrt{5}}{2} - 2 = 3 - sqrt{5} - 2 = 1 - sqrt{5} )So, points ( A ) and ( B ) are ( left( frac{3 + sqrt{5}}{2}, 1 + sqrt{5} right) ) and ( left( frac{3 - sqrt{5}}{2}, 1 - sqrt{5} right) ).Now, let's compute the slopes of ( MA ) and ( MB ).Point ( M ) is ( (-1, 1) ).Slope of ( MA ):( m_{MA} = frac{(1 + sqrt{5}) - 1}{frac{3 + sqrt{5}}{2} - (-1)} = frac{sqrt{5}}{frac{3 + sqrt{5}}{2} + 1} = frac{sqrt{5}}{frac{3 + sqrt{5} + 2}{2}} = frac{sqrt{5}}{frac{5 + sqrt{5}}{2}} = frac{2sqrt{5}}{5 + sqrt{5}} )Multiply numerator and denominator by ( 5 - sqrt{5} ):( frac{2sqrt{5}(5 - sqrt{5})}{(5 + sqrt{5})(5 - sqrt{5})} = frac{10sqrt{5} - 2 times 5}{25 - 5} = frac{10sqrt{5} - 10}{20} = frac{10(sqrt{5} - 1)}{20} = frac{sqrt{5} - 1}{2} )Similarly, slope of ( MB ):( m_{MB} = frac{(1 - sqrt{5}) - 1}{frac{3 - sqrt{5}}{2} - (-1)} = frac{-sqrt{5}}{frac{3 - sqrt{5}}{2} + 1} = frac{-sqrt{5}}{frac{3 - sqrt{5} + 2}{2}} = frac{-sqrt{5}}{frac{5 - sqrt{5}}{2}} = frac{-2sqrt{5}}{5 - sqrt{5}} )Multiply numerator and denominator by ( 5 + sqrt{5} ):( frac{-2sqrt{5}(5 + sqrt{5})}{(5 - sqrt{5})(5 + sqrt{5})} = frac{-10sqrt{5} - 2 times 5}{25 - 5} = frac{-10sqrt{5} - 10}{20} = frac{-10(sqrt{5} + 1)}{20} = frac{-(sqrt{5} + 1)}{2} )So, the slopes are ( m_{MA} = frac{sqrt{5} - 1}{2} ) and ( m_{MB} = frac{-(sqrt{5} + 1)}{2} ).Now, let's compute the product of these slopes:( m_{MA} times m_{MB} = left( frac{sqrt{5} - 1}{2} right) times left( frac{-(sqrt{5} + 1)}{2} right) )Multiply the numerators:( (sqrt{5} - 1)(-(sqrt{5} + 1)) = -(sqrt{5} - 1)(sqrt{5} + 1) )This is a difference of squares:( -[(sqrt{5})^2 - (1)^2] = -(5 - 1) = -4 )So, the product is:( frac{-4}{4} = -1 )Which confirms that the product of the slopes is indeed ( -1 ), meaning that ( MA ) and ( MB ) are perpendicular, so ( angle AMB = 90^circ ). Therefore, ( k = 2 ) is the correct solution.Wait, but just to make sure, is there another possible value for ( k )? Because sometimes when dealing with quadratics, especially when squaring or substituting, you might introduce extraneous solutions or miss some.Looking back at the quadratic equation for ( u ), we had only one solution ( u = 1/2 ), leading to ( k = 2 ). So, it seems like ( k = 2 ) is the only solution. Let me think if there's another way this could happen.Alternatively, maybe the line could be vertical or horizontal, but in this case, the line passes through the focus ( (1, 0) ), so a vertical line would have an undefined slope, but since the problem specifies a slope ( k ), which is a real number, vertical lines are excluded. Similarly, a horizontal line would have slope 0, but let's check if that works.If ( k = 0 ), the line would be ( y = 0 ), which is the x-axis. It intersects the parabola ( y^2 = 4x ) at ( y = 0 ), so ( x = 0 ). So, only one point of intersection, which is ( (0, 0) ). But we need two points ( A ) and ( B ), so ( k = 0 ) is not acceptable. Therefore, ( k = 2 ) is the only valid solution.Just to recap, the steps were:1. Identify the focus of the parabola.2. Write the equation of the line through the focus with slope ( k ).3. Find the points of intersection ( A ) and ( B ) by solving the system of equations.4. Use the condition ( angle AMB = 90^circ ) to set up an equation involving the slopes of ( MA ) and ( MB ).5. Solve the resulting equation for ( k ).6. Verify the solution by plugging back into the original problem.Everything seems to check out, so I think ( k = 2 ) is the correct answer.**Final Answer**The value of ( k ) is boxed{2}."},{"question":"Emily consumes 1800 calories every day, except for Sunday, when she eats an additional 500 calories.

Since she has more items than space, Rebecca will have to leave some things behind to meet the weight requirement. In kg, how much will Rebecca have to leave out of the boxes?","answer":"First, I need to calculate the total weight of all the items Rebecca has. She has 8 bags of books, each weighing 4 kg, so the total weight of the books is 8 multiplied by 4, which equals 32 kg.Next, there are 16 bags of clothes, each weighing 3 kg. The total weight of the clothes is 16 multiplied by 3, resulting in 48 kg.Then, there are 6 bags of tools, each weighing 20 kg. The total weight of the tools is 6 multiplied by 20, which equals 120 kg.Adding all these together, the total weight of all items is 32 kg (books) + 48 kg (clothes) + 120 kg (tools) = 200 kg.Rebecca has 12 boxes, and each box has a weight limit of 30 kg. Therefore, the total weight capacity of all the boxes is 12 multiplied by 30, which equals 360 kg.Since the total weight of the items (200 kg) is less than the total capacity of the boxes (360 kg), Rebecca does not need to leave any items behind.

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that the distance from a point to a line in 3D space can be found using the formula involving the cross product. The formula is:Distance = |(P2 - P1) √ó v| / |v|Where P1 is a point on the line, P2 is the given point, and v is the direction vector of the line.So, let me identify the components here. The line l is given in the symmetric form, which is (x - x0)/a = (y - y0)/b = (z - z0)/c. Comparing this with the given equation, I can see that x0 = 1, y0 = -2, z0 = 0. So, a point on the line l is (1, -2, 0). Let's call this point Q(1, -2, 0).The direction vector v of the line can be read from the denominators of the symmetric equations. So, a = -2, b = 1, c = 0. Therefore, the direction vector v is (-2, 1, 0).Now, the vector from Q to P is P - Q, which is (-7 - 1, -13 - (-2), 10 - 0) = (-8, -11, 10). Let's denote this vector as w = (-8, -11, 10).Next, I need to compute the cross product of w and v. The cross product w √ó v will give a vector perpendicular to both w and v, and its magnitude will be equal to the area of the parallelogram formed by w and v. Then, the distance will be this area divided by the magnitude of v.Let me compute the cross product:w √ó v = |i ¬†¬†j ¬†¬†k|¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† |-8 -11 10|¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† |-2 ¬†¬†1 ¬†¬†0|Calculating the determinant:i * (-11*0 - 10*1) - j * (-8*0 - 10*(-2)) + k * (-8*1 - (-11)*(-2))Simplify each component:i * (0 - 10) - j * (0 + 20) + k * (-8 - 22)Which is:-10i - 20j - 30kSo, the cross product vector is (-10, -20, -30). Now, let's find its magnitude:|w √ó v| = sqrt((-10)^2 + (-20)^2 + (-30)^2) = sqrt(100 + 400 + 900) = sqrt(1400)Simplify sqrt(1400). Let's see, 1400 = 100 * 14, so sqrt(100*14) = 10*sqrt(14). So, |w √ó v| = 10‚àö14.Now, the magnitude of the direction vector v is |v| = sqrt((-2)^2 + 1^2 + 0^2) = sqrt(4 + 1 + 0) = sqrt(5).Therefore, the distance from P to the line l is |w √ó v| / |v| = (10‚àö14) / ‚àö5.Simplify this expression. Let's rationalize the denominator:(10‚àö14) / ‚àö5 = 10‚àö(14/5) = 10‚àö(14/5) = 10*(‚àö14 / ‚àö5) = (10‚àö14)/‚àö5.Alternatively, we can write this as 10‚àö(14/5). But perhaps we can simplify ‚àö(14/5). Let me see:‚àö(14/5) = ‚àö(14)/‚àö5, which is the same as before. Alternatively, we can write it as ‚àö(70)/5 because:‚àö(14/5) = ‚àö(14*5)/5 = ‚àö70/5.Wait, let me check that:‚àö(14/5) = ‚àö(14)/‚àö5 = (‚àö14 * ‚àö5)/ (‚àö5 * ‚àö5) )= ‚àö70 / 5.Yes, that's correct. So, 10‚àö(14/5) = 10*(‚àö70 / 5) = 2‚àö70.So, the distance simplifies to 2‚àö70.Wait, let me verify my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.1. Point Q on the line l is (1, -2, 0). Correct.2. Direction vector v is (-2, 1, 0). Correct.3. Vector w = P - Q = (-8, -11, 10). Correct.4. Cross product w √ó v = (-10, -20, -30). Let me recalculate the cross product to make sure.Compute i component: (-11)(0) - (10)(1) = 0 - 10 = -10.j component: - [(-8)(0) - (10)(-2)] = - [0 + 20] = -20.k component: (-8)(1) - (-11)(-2) = -8 - 22 = -30.Yes, that's correct. So, cross product is (-10, -20, -30).Magnitude: sqrt(100 + 400 + 900) = sqrt(1400) = 10‚àö14. Correct.|v| = sqrt(4 + 1 + 0) = sqrt(5). Correct.So, distance is 10‚àö14 / sqrt(5) = 10‚àö(14/5) = 10*(‚àö70)/5 = 2‚àö70. Yes, that's correct.Alternatively, 2‚àö70 is approximately 16.733, but since the question doesn't specify, the exact value is fine.Wait, hold on. Let me think again. Is the formula correct? Because sometimes I get confused between the distance formula and projection.Wait, the formula is |(P - Q) √ó v| / |v|. Yes, that's correct. So, that's the distance.Alternatively, another way to compute the distance is to parametrize the line and then minimize the distance function, but that might be more complicated.Alternatively, I can use the formula for the distance from a point to a line in 3D:Distance = |(P - Q) √ó v| / |v|Which is exactly what I did. So, I think my steps are correct.Wait, but let me check the cross product calculation again because sometimes signs can be tricky.Given w = (-8, -11, 10) and v = (-2, 1, 0).Compute cross product:i component: (-11)(0) - (10)(1) = 0 - 10 = -10.j component: - [(-8)(0) - (10)(-2)] = - [0 + 20] = -20.k component: (-8)(1) - (-11)(-2) = -8 - 22 = -30.Yes, that's correct. So, cross product is (-10, -20, -30).So, the magnitude is sqrt(100 + 400 + 900) = sqrt(1400) = 10‚àö14.Divide by |v| = sqrt(5). So, 10‚àö14 / sqrt(5) = 10‚àö(14/5) = 10*(‚àö70)/5 = 2‚àö70.Yes, that seems correct.Alternatively, another way to compute this is to write the parametric equations of the line and then find the minimum distance.Let me try that approach to verify.Parametric equations of line l:x = 1 - 2ty = -2 + tz = 0 + 0t = 0So, any point on the line can be written as (1 - 2t, -2 + t, 0).Point P is (-7, -13, 10).The vector from a general point on the line to P is:(-7 - (1 - 2t), -13 - (-2 + t), 10 - 0) = (-8 + 2t, -11 - t, 10).The distance squared from P to a point on the line is:D¬≤ = (-8 + 2t)^2 + (-11 - t)^2 + 10^2.To find the minimum distance, we can minimize D¬≤ with respect to t.Compute D¬≤:= (64 - 32t + 4t¬≤) + (121 + 22t + t¬≤) + 100Simplify:64 - 32t + 4t¬≤ + 121 + 22t + t¬≤ + 100Combine like terms:(4t¬≤ + t¬≤) + (-32t + 22t) + (64 + 121 + 100)= 5t¬≤ - 10t + 285Now, take derivative with respect to t and set to zero:d(D¬≤)/dt = 10t - 10 = 0 => 10t = 10 => t = 1.So, the minimum distance occurs at t = 1.Now, plug t = 1 into D¬≤:5(1)^2 - 10(1) + 285 = 5 - 10 + 285 = 280.Therefore, the minimum distance is sqrt(280).Simplify sqrt(280). 280 = 4*70, so sqrt(4*70) = 2‚àö70.So, the distance is 2‚àö70, which matches my earlier result.Therefore, both methods give the same answer, so I'm confident that the distance is 2‚àö70.**Final Answer**The distance from point ( P ) to the line ( l ) is boxed{2sqrt{70}}."},{"question":"Given that all terms of the geometric sequence {a_n} are positive, and a_1 = 3, the sum of the first three terms is 21. Find the sum of a_4 + a_5 + a_6.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem about a geometric sequence. Let me read it again: all terms are positive, the first term a‚ÇÅ is 3, and the sum of the first three terms is 21. I need to find the sum of a‚ÇÑ + a‚ÇÖ + a‚ÇÜ. Hmm, okay.First, let me recall what a geometric sequence is. It's a sequence where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant called the common ratio, usually denoted as r. So, the nth term of a geometric sequence can be written as a‚Çô = a‚ÇÅ * r^(n-1).Given that a‚ÇÅ is 3, so the first term is 3. Then the second term is 3r, the third term is 3r¬≤, and so on. So, the first three terms are 3, 3r, and 3r¬≤.The sum of the first three terms is given as 21. So, I can write that equation:3 + 3r + 3r¬≤ = 21.Hmm, let me write that down:3 + 3r + 3r¬≤ = 21.I can factor out a 3 from the left side:3(1 + r + r¬≤) = 21.Then, divide both sides by 3:1 + r + r¬≤ = 7.So, that simplifies to:r¬≤ + r + 1 = 7.Subtract 7 from both sides:r¬≤ + r + 1 - 7 = 0Which is:r¬≤ + r - 6 = 0.Okay, so now I have a quadratic equation: r¬≤ + r - 6 = 0.I need to solve for r. Let me try factoring this quadratic.Looking for two numbers that multiply to -6 and add up to 1. Hmm, factors of -6 are (1, -6), (-1, 6), (2, -3), (-2, 3). Let's see:3 and -2: 3 * (-2) = -6, and 3 + (-2) = 1. Perfect.So, the quadratic factors as:(r + 3)(r - 2) = 0.So, the solutions are r = -3 or r = 2.But wait, the problem says all terms are positive. So, the common ratio r must be positive because if r were negative, some terms would be negative. For example, if r = -3, then a‚ÇÇ = 3*(-3) = -9, which is negative. But the problem states all terms are positive, so r must be positive. Therefore, r = 2.Alright, so the common ratio is 2. Now, I need to find the sum of a‚ÇÑ + a‚ÇÖ + a‚ÇÜ.Let me find each of these terms.First, a‚ÇÑ is the fourth term. Since a‚ÇÅ = 3, a‚ÇÑ = a‚ÇÅ * r^(4-1) = 3 * 2¬≥.Similarly, a‚ÇÖ = 3 * 2‚Å¥, and a‚ÇÜ = 3 * 2‚Åµ.So, let me compute each:a‚ÇÑ = 3 * 8 = 24,a‚ÇÖ = 3 * 16 = 48,a‚ÇÜ = 3 * 32 = 96.So, adding them up: 24 + 48 + 96.Let me compute that:24 + 48 is 72, and 72 + 96 is 168.So, the sum of a‚ÇÑ + a‚ÇÖ + a‚ÇÜ is 168.Wait, let me check if there's another way to compute this without calculating each term individually. Maybe using the formula for the sum of a geometric series.The sum of the first n terms of a geometric sequence is S‚Çô = a‚ÇÅ(1 - r‚Åø)/(1 - r) when r ‚â† 1.But in this case, I don't need the sum of the first six terms; I need the sum from the fourth to the sixth term. So, perhaps I can compute S‚ÇÜ - S‚ÇÉ.Yes, that's a good idea. Because S‚ÇÜ is the sum of the first six terms, and S‚ÇÉ is the sum of the first three terms. So, S‚ÇÜ - S‚ÇÉ would be the sum of a‚ÇÑ + a‚ÇÖ + a‚ÇÜ.Given that S‚ÇÉ is 21, as given in the problem. So, if I can compute S‚ÇÜ, then subtract 21, I'll get the desired sum.Let me compute S‚ÇÜ.Using the formula:S‚ÇÜ = a‚ÇÅ(1 - r‚Å∂)/(1 - r).We know a‚ÇÅ = 3, r = 2.So, S‚ÇÜ = 3*(1 - 2‚Å∂)/(1 - 2).Compute 2‚Å∂: 2‚Å∂ = 64.So, 1 - 64 = -63.Denominator: 1 - 2 = -1.So, S‚ÇÜ = 3*(-63)/(-1) = 3*63 = 189.Therefore, S‚ÇÜ = 189, and S‚ÇÉ = 21.So, the sum from a‚ÇÑ to a‚ÇÜ is 189 - 21 = 168.Same result as before. So, that's a good check.Alternatively, another way to think about it is that a‚ÇÑ + a‚ÇÖ + a‚ÇÜ is equal to r¬≥ times the sum of the first three terms.Because each term from a‚ÇÑ onwards is r¬≥ times the corresponding term in the first three terms.So, a‚ÇÑ = a‚ÇÅ*r¬≥, a‚ÇÖ = a‚ÇÇ*r¬≥, a‚ÇÜ = a‚ÇÉ*r¬≥.Therefore, a‚ÇÑ + a‚ÇÖ + a‚ÇÜ = r¬≥*(a‚ÇÅ + a‚ÇÇ + a‚ÇÉ) = r¬≥*S‚ÇÉ.Given that S‚ÇÉ is 21, and r = 2, so r¬≥ = 8.So, 8*21 = 168.Again, same result. So, that's another way to see it.So, all methods lead to 168. Therefore, I can be confident that the sum of a‚ÇÑ + a‚ÇÖ + a‚ÇÜ is 168.**Final Answer**The sum of (a_4 + a_5 + a_6) is boxed{168}."},{"question":"Mike decides to do more pull-ups to increase his strength for climbing.

This gives me 990.Next, I'll determine how many terms are in this series.

Ethan owns one-third of Ava's Siamese cats, which is 5 divided by 3, resulting in approximately 1.666. Since the number of cats must be a whole number, I'll round this to 2 Siamese cats for Ethan. Lucas owns no Siamese cats.Next, I'll calculate the number of British Shorthairs each person has. Ava has 3 British Shorthairs. Ethan has two more than Ava, which is 3 plus 2, totaling 5 British Shorthairs. Lucas has two fewer British Shorthairs than Ethan, so that's 5 minus 2, which equals 3 British Shorthairs.Finally, I'll add up all the cats. For Siamese cats: Ava has 5, Ethan has 2, and Lucas has 0, totaling 7. For British Shorthairs: Ava has 3, Ethan has 5, and Lucas has 3, totaling 11.

Two-thirds of 80 professors is (2/3) * 80 = 53.333... Since the number of professors must be a whole number, this suggests there might be an error in the problem statement or interpretation.Assuming the number of professors is adjusted to a multiple of 3, let's say 78 professors. Then, two-thirds of 78 is 52 professors who brought an assistant, resulting in 52 assistants.Next, determine the total number of assistants at the conference. If two-thirds of the assistants were not accompanying a professor, then one-third were accompanying professors. Therefore, 52 assistants represent one-third of the total assistants, which means the total number of assistants is 52 * 3 = 156.Finally, calculate the total number of people at the conference by adding the number of professors and assistants: 78 professors + 156 assistants = 234 people."},{"question":"Max makes 8 an hour for lawn-mowing.

Determine the minimum value of S_n.","answer":"Okay, so I have this problem here with two vectors, a and b. Vector a is (1, 2), and vector b is (1/(n¬≤ + n), a_n), where n is a positive integer. The condition given is that vector a is parallel to vector b. I need to find the sum of the first n terms of the sequence {a_n}, which is S_n, and then determine the minimum value of S_n.Hmm, let me start by recalling what it means for two vectors to be parallel. If two vectors are parallel, one must be a scalar multiple of the other. So, that means there exists some scalar k such that vector a = k * vector b. In other words, each component of vector a is k times the corresponding component of vector b.So, writing that out, for vector a = (1, 2) and vector b = (1/(n¬≤ + n), a_n), we have:1 = k * (1/(n¬≤ + n))  2 = k * a_nOkay, so from the first equation, I can solve for k. Let me do that.From 1 = k * (1/(n¬≤ + n)), multiplying both sides by (n¬≤ + n) gives:k = n¬≤ + nNow that I have k, I can plug it into the second equation to find a_n.From 2 = k * a_n, substituting k:2 = (n¬≤ + n) * a_nSo, solving for a_n:a_n = 2 / (n¬≤ + n)Alright, so now I know that a_n is equal to 2 divided by (n squared plus n). That simplifies to 2/(n(n + 1)). Hmm, that looks like it can be broken down using partial fractions.Let me try that. So, 2/(n(n + 1)) can be written as A/n + B/(n + 1). Let me solve for A and B.Multiplying both sides by n(n + 1):2 = A(n + 1) + BnExpanding the right side:2 = An + A + BnCombine like terms:2 = (A + B)n + ANow, since this must hold for all n, the coefficients of like terms must be equal on both sides. So, the coefficient of n on the left is 0, and the constant term is 2.Therefore, we have:A + B = 0  A = 2From the second equation, A = 2. Plugging that into the first equation:2 + B = 0  B = -2So, the partial fractions decomposition is:a_n = 2/n - 2/(n + 1)Cool, so now I have a_n expressed as a telescoping series. That should make finding the sum S_n easier.So, S_n is the sum of the first n terms of {a_n}, which is:S_n = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + ... + a_nSubstituting the expression for a_k:S_n = (2/1 - 2/2) + (2/2 - 2/3) + (2/3 - 2/4) + ... + (2/n - 2/(n + 1))Let me write this out term by term to see the cancellation:First term: 2/1 - 2/2  Second term: 2/2 - 2/3  Third term: 2/3 - 2/4  ...  n-th term: 2/n - 2/(n + 1)When we add all these up, most of the intermediate terms should cancel out. Let's see:The -2/2 from the first term cancels with the +2/2 from the second term. Similarly, the -2/3 from the second term cancels with the +2/3 from the third term, and so on. This pattern continues until the last term.So, after cancellation, we're left with the first term of the first expression and the last term of the last expression. That is:S_n = 2/1 - 2/(n + 1)Simplify that:S_n = 2 - 2/(n + 1)Hmm, okay. So, S_n is equal to 2 minus 2 over (n + 1). Now, the problem asks for the minimum value of S_n.Wait, but S_n is a function of n, and n is a positive integer (n ‚àà ‚Ñï*). So, I need to find the minimum value of S_n as n varies over the positive integers.Let me think about how S_n behaves as n increases. Let's write S_n as:S_n = 2 - 2/(n + 1)As n increases, the term 2/(n + 1) decreases because the denominator is getting larger. So, S_n is approaching 2 from below as n becomes large.Therefore, S_n is an increasing sequence approaching 2. So, the minimum value of S_n should occur at the smallest n, which is n = 1.Wait, let me check that. For n = 1:S_1 = 2 - 2/(1 + 1) = 2 - 1 = 1For n = 2:S_2 = 2 - 2/(2 + 1) = 2 - 2/3 ‚âà 1.333...For n = 3:S_3 = 2 - 2/4 = 2 - 0.5 = 1.5Wait, hold on, that's not increasing. Wait, S_1 is 1, S_2 is 1.333..., S_3 is 1.5, which is indeed increasing.Wait, but 1.333 is more than 1, so S_n is increasing as n increases. So, the minimum value is at n = 1, which is 1.But let me verify this with n = 1, 2, 3, 4 to see the trend.n=1: S_1 = 2 - 2/2 = 2 - 1 = 1  n=2: S_2 = 2 - 2/3 ‚âà 1.333  n=3: S_3 = 2 - 2/4 = 2 - 0.5 = 1.5  n=4: S_4 = 2 - 2/5 = 2 - 0.4 = 1.6  n=5: S_5 = 2 - 2/6 ‚âà 2 - 0.333 ‚âà 1.666  ...  As n approaches infinity, S_n approaches 2.So, yes, S_n is increasing with n, starting at 1 when n=1 and approaching 2 as n becomes large. Therefore, the minimum value of S_n is 1, achieved when n=1.Wait, but hold on a second. The problem says \\"the sum of the first n terms of the sequence {a_n} be S_n.\\" So, S_n is defined for each n, and we're to find the minimum value of S_n over all positive integers n.So, since S_n increases as n increases, the minimum occurs at the smallest n, which is n=1.But just to make sure, let me compute S_n for n=1,2,3,4,5.n=1: a_1 = 2/(1*(1+1)) = 2/2 = 1. So, S_1 = 1.n=2: a_1 + a_2 = 1 + 2/(2*3) = 1 + 1/3 ‚âà 1.333...n=3: 1 + 1/3 + 2/(3*4) = 1 + 1/3 + 1/6 = 1 + 1/2 = 1.5n=4: 1 + 1/3 + 1/6 + 2/(4*5) = 1 + 1/3 + 1/6 + 1/10 ‚âà 1 + 0.333 + 0.166 + 0.1 ‚âà 1.6n=5: Adding 2/(5*6) = 1/15 ‚âà 0.066, so total ‚âà 1.666...So, yes, each time we add a positive term, so S_n is increasing. Therefore, the minimum is indeed at n=1, which is 1.But wait, hold on. The problem says \\"the sum of the first n terms of the sequence {a_n} be S_n.\\" So, for each n, S_n is defined as the sum of the first n terms. So, S_n is a function defined for each n, and we have to find its minimum value over all n.But in our case, S_n = 2 - 2/(n + 1). So, as n increases, S_n approaches 2. So, S_n is increasing with n, so the minimum is at n=1.But wait, let me think again. Is S_n always increasing? Let me check the difference between S_{n} and S_{n-1}.S_n = 2 - 2/(n + 1)  S_{n-1} = 2 - 2/nSo, S_n - S_{n-1} = [2 - 2/(n + 1)] - [2 - 2/n] = -2/(n + 1) + 2/n = 2(1/n - 1/(n + 1)) = 2/(n(n + 1)) > 0So, the difference is positive, which means S_n is increasing with n. Therefore, the minimum occurs at the smallest n, which is n=1.Therefore, the minimum value of S_n is 1.Wait, but hold on, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the partial fractions.We had a_n = 2/(n(n + 1)) = 2/n - 2/(n + 1). So, when we sum from 1 to n, it's telescoping:Sum_{k=1}^n [2/k - 2/(k + 1)] = 2/1 - 2/(n + 1). So, yes, that's correct.So, S_n = 2 - 2/(n + 1). So, as n increases, 2/(n + 1) decreases, so S_n increases towards 2.Therefore, the minimum is at n=1, which is 1.Wait, but just to make sure, let me compute S_n for n=1,2,3,4,5 as before:n=1: 1  n=2: 1 + 1/3 ‚âà 1.333  n=3: 1 + 1/3 + 1/6 = 1.5  n=4: 1 + 1/3 + 1/6 + 1/10 ‚âà 1.6  n=5: ‚âà1.666...So, yes, it's increasing each time.Therefore, the minimum value of S_n is 1, achieved when n=1.But wait, hold on. The problem says \\"the sum of the first n terms of the sequence {a_n} be S_n.\\" So, S_n is defined for each n, and we have to find the minimum value of S_n over all n.But in our case, S_n = 2 - 2/(n + 1). So, as n increases, S_n approaches 2. So, S_n is increasing with n, so the minimum is at n=1.But wait, is n allowed to be 1? The problem says n ‚àà ‚Ñï*, which is the set of positive integers, so yes, n=1 is allowed.Therefore, the minimum value of S_n is 1.Wait, but let me make sure that S_n is indeed 2 - 2/(n + 1). Let me rederive it.Given a_n = 2/(n(n + 1)) = 2/n - 2/(n + 1). So, summing from k=1 to n:Sum_{k=1}^n a_k = Sum_{k=1}^n [2/k - 2/(k + 1)] = 2 Sum_{k=1}^n 1/k - 2 Sum_{k=1}^n 1/(k + 1)But the second sum is Sum_{k=1}^n 1/(k + 1) = Sum_{m=2}^{n + 1} 1/mTherefore, the total sum is:2 [Sum_{k=1}^n 1/k] - 2 [Sum_{m=2}^{n + 1} 1/m] = 2 [1 + Sum_{k=2}^n 1/k] - 2 [Sum_{m=2}^{n + 1} 1/m]= 2*1 + 2 Sum_{k=2}^n 1/k - 2 Sum_{m=2}^{n + 1} 1/m= 2 + 2 Sum_{k=2}^n 1/k - 2 Sum_{m=2}^{n + 1} 1/m= 2 + 2 [Sum_{k=2}^n 1/k - Sum_{m=2}^{n + 1} 1/m]= 2 + 2 [ -1/(n + 1) ]= 2 - 2/(n + 1)Yes, that's correct. So, S_n = 2 - 2/(n + 1). So, as n increases, S_n approaches 2 from below.Therefore, the minimum value is at n=1, which is 1.Wait, but hold on, let me think again. The problem says \\"the sum of the first n terms of the sequence {a_n} be S_n.\\" So, S_n is defined for each n, and we have to find the minimum value of S_n over all n.But in our case, S_n = 2 - 2/(n + 1). So, as n increases, S_n approaches 2. So, S_n is increasing with n, so the minimum is at n=1.But wait, let me check n=1:a_1 = 2/(1*(1 + 1)) = 2/2 = 1  So, S_1 = 1n=2:a_1 + a_2 = 1 + 2/(2*3) = 1 + 1/3 ‚âà 1.333...n=3:1 + 1/3 + 2/(3*4) = 1 + 1/3 + 1/6 = 1 + 1/2 = 1.5n=4:1 + 1/3 + 1/6 + 2/(4*5) = 1 + 1/3 + 1/6 + 1/10 ‚âà 1.6n=5:‚âà1.666...So, yes, each time, S_n is increasing. Therefore, the minimum is indeed at n=1, which is 1.Therefore, the minimum value of S_n is 1.But wait, hold on. Let me think again about the problem statement.It says: \\"Given the vectors a = (1, 2) and b = (1/(n¬≤ + n), a_n) (n ‚àà ‚Ñï*), if a is parallel to b, let the sum of the first n terms of the sequence {a_n} be S_n. Determine the minimum value of S_n.\\"Wait, so for each n, we have a vector b_n = (1/(n¬≤ + n), a_n). So, for each n, a is parallel to b_n, which gives us a_n = 2/(n¬≤ + n). So, the sequence {a_n} is defined as a_n = 2/(n¬≤ + n).Then, S_n is the sum of the first n terms of {a_n}, so S_n = a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_n.We found that S_n = 2 - 2/(n + 1), which is increasing with n, so the minimum is at n=1, which is 1.Therefore, the minimum value of S_n is 1.But just to make sure, let me compute S_n for n=1,2,3,4,5 again:n=1: 1  n=2: 1 + 1/3 ‚âà 1.333  n=3: 1.5  n=4: ‚âà1.6  n=5: ‚âà1.666...So, yes, it's increasing. Therefore, the minimum is 1.But wait, hold on. Is S_n defined for each n, and we have to find the minimum over all n? So, for n=1, S_1=1; for n=2, S_2‚âà1.333; and so on. So, the minimum is indeed 1.Therefore, the answer is 1.But wait, let me think once more. The problem says \\"the sum of the first n terms of the sequence {a_n} be S_n.\\" So, S_n is a function of n, and we have to find its minimum value.But S_n = 2 - 2/(n + 1). So, as n increases, S_n approaches 2. So, S_n is increasing with n, so the minimum is at n=1, which is 1.Therefore, the minimum value of S_n is 1.I think that's correct.**Final Answer**The minimum value of ( S_n ) is boxed{1}."},{"question":"If ( p, q, ) and ( r ) are the distinct roots of ( x^3 - x^2 + x - 2 = 0 ), then what is ( p^3 + q^3 + r^3 )?(A) -1  (B) 1  (C) 3  (D) 5  (E) None of these  (26th American High School Mathematics Examination, 1975)","answer":"Alright, so I have this problem here: If ( p, q, ) and ( r ) are the distinct roots of the cubic equation ( x^3 - x^2 + x - 2 = 0 ), then I need to find ( p^3 + q^3 + r^3 ). The options are (A) -1, (B) 1, (C) 3, (D) 5, and (E) None of these. Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.First, I remember that for polynomials, especially cubic ones, Vieta's formulas can be really helpful. Vieta's relates the coefficients of the polynomial to sums and products of its roots. So, maybe I can use that here. Let me recall Vieta's formulas for a cubic equation.Given a cubic equation ( x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c = 0 ), the sums and products of its roots ( p, q, r ) are given by:- ( p + q + r = -a )- ( pq + pr + qr = b )- ( pqr = -c )Wait, in our case, the equation is ( x^3 - x^2 + x - 2 = 0 ). So, let me rewrite it in the standard form to match the coefficients correctly. Comparing to ( x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c = 0 ), we have:- ( a = -1 ) (since the coefficient of ( x^2 ) is -1)- ( b = 1 ) (coefficient of x is 1)- ( c = -2 ) (constant term is -2)So, applying Vieta's formulas:1. ( p + q + r = -a = -(-1) = 1 )2. ( pq + pr + qr = b = 1 )3. ( pqr = -c = -(-2) = 2 )Okay, so we have:- Sum of roots: ( p + q + r = 1 )- Sum of products two at a time: ( pq + pr + qr = 1 )- Product of roots: ( pqr = 2 )Now, the question is asking for ( p^3 + q^3 + r^3 ). Hmm, how do I compute that? I remember there's a formula for the sum of cubes of roots. Let me recall it.I think it's related to the identity:( p^3 + q^3 + r^3 = (p + q + r)^3 - 3(p + q + r)(pq + pr + qr) + 3pqr )Wait, is that correct? Let me verify. Let's expand ( (p + q + r)^3 ):( (p + q + r)^3 = p^3 + q^3 + r^3 + 3(p + q)(q + r)(r + p) ) Hmm, no, that's not right. Wait, actually, let me think again.Alternatively, I know that ( p^3 + q^3 + r^3 ) can be expressed in terms of the sums and products of the roots. Since each root satisfies the original equation, maybe I can use that to find ( p^3 ), ( q^3 ), and ( r^3 ) individually.Wait, that's a good point. Since ( p ) is a root of the equation ( x^3 - x^2 + x - 2 = 0 ), plugging ( p ) into the equation gives:( p^3 - p^2 + p - 2 = 0 )So, rearranging, ( p^3 = p^2 - p + 2 )Similarly, for ( q ) and ( r ):( q^3 = q^2 - q + 2 )( r^3 = r^2 - r + 2 )Therefore, if I add them all together:( p^3 + q^3 + r^3 = (p^2 - p + 2) + (q^2 - q + 2) + (r^2 - r + 2) )Simplify this:( p^3 + q^3 + r^3 = (p^2 + q^2 + r^2) - (p + q + r) + 6 )Okay, so now I need to find ( p^2 + q^2 + r^2 ). Hmm, I remember that ( p^2 + q^2 + r^2 ) can be expressed in terms of ( (p + q + r)^2 - 2(pq + pr + qr) ). Let me confirm that.Yes, because:( (p + q + r)^2 = p^2 + q^2 + r^2 + 2(pq + pr + qr) )So, solving for ( p^2 + q^2 + r^2 ):( p^2 + q^2 + r^2 = (p + q + r)^2 - 2(pq + pr + qr) )We already know ( p + q + r = 1 ) and ( pq + pr + qr = 1 ). So plugging those in:( p^2 + q^2 + r^2 = (1)^2 - 2(1) = 1 - 2 = -1 )Wait, that can't be right. Squares of real numbers can't be negative. Hmm, but the roots could be complex, right? Because the equation is a cubic with real coefficients, so it must have at least one real root, but the other two could be complex conjugates. So, their squares could sum to a negative number if they are complex. Okay, that makes sense.So, ( p^2 + q^2 + r^2 = -1 ). Then, going back to ( p^3 + q^3 + r^3 ):( p^3 + q^3 + r^3 = (-1) - (1) + 6 = (-1 -1) + 6 = (-2) + 6 = 4 )Wait, so that gives me 4. But looking at the options, 4 isn't there. The options are -1, 1, 3, 5, or None of these. So, is 4 one of the options? No, it's not. So, does that mean the answer is (E) None of these?But wait, let me double-check my calculations because 4 is not one of the options. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere.Let me go through the steps again.1. The equation is ( x^3 - x^2 + x - 2 = 0 ). So, for each root ( p ), ( p^3 = p^2 - p + 2 ). Similarly for ( q ) and ( r ). So, adding them:( p^3 + q^3 + r^3 = (p^2 + q^2 + r^2) - (p + q + r) + 6 )2. To find ( p^2 + q^2 + r^2 ), we use ( (p + q + r)^2 - 2(pq + pr + qr) ).Given ( p + q + r = 1 ) and ( pq + pr + qr = 1 ), so:( (1)^2 - 2(1) = 1 - 2 = -1 ). So, that's correct.3. Then, ( p^3 + q^3 + r^3 = (-1) - (1) + 6 = 4 ). Hmm, that seems correct.But 4 isn't an option. So, maybe I made a mistake in the initial step.Wait, let me think differently. Maybe I can use the identity for ( p^3 + q^3 + r^3 ) directly.I recall that ( p^3 + q^3 + r^3 = (p + q + r)^3 - 3(p + q + r)(pq + pr + qr) + 3pqr ). Let me compute that.Given:- ( p + q + r = 1 )- ( pq + pr + qr = 1 )- ( pqr = 2 )So, plugging into the formula:( (1)^3 - 3(1)(1) + 3(2) = 1 - 3 + 6 = 4 )Same result. So, that's consistent. So, 4 is the answer. But 4 isn't among the options. The options are (A) -1, (B) 1, (C) 3, (D) 5, (E) None of these.Therefore, the correct answer must be (E) None of these.But wait, let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the identity. Let me verify the formula for ( p^3 + q^3 + r^3 ).Yes, the formula is:( p^3 + q^3 + r^3 = (p + q + r)^3 - 3(p + q + r)(pq + pr + qr) + 3pqr )Let me compute each term step by step.1. ( (p + q + r)^3 = 1^3 = 1 )2. ( 3(p + q + r)(pq + pr + qr) = 3(1)(1) = 3 )3. ( 3pqr = 3(2) = 6 )So, putting it all together:( 1 - 3 + 6 = 4 ). So, that's correct.Alternatively, using the other method, I also got 4. So, seems like 4 is the correct answer.But since 4 isn't an option, the answer must be (E). Hmm.Wait, but let me think again. Maybe I misapplied the formula. Let me check the formula for ( p^3 + q^3 + r^3 ).Alternatively, another approach is to note that since each root satisfies the equation ( x^3 = x^2 - x + 2 ), so ( p^3 = p^2 - p + 2 ), same for q and r.Therefore, ( p^3 + q^3 + r^3 = (p^2 + q^2 + r^2) - (p + q + r) + 6 ). As before.We found ( p^2 + q^2 + r^2 = -1 ), so ( -1 -1 +6 = 4 ). So, same result.Alternatively, maybe the question is written incorrectly? Or perhaps I misread the equation.Wait, the equation is ( x^3 - x^2 + x - 2 = 0 ). So, coefficients are 1, -1, 1, -2.Yes, so Vieta's gives sum of roots 1, sum of products 1, product 2.Wait, is there another way to compute ( p^3 + q^3 + r^3 )?Alternatively, perhaps using Newton's identities, which relate power sums to elementary symmetric sums.Newton's formulas state that for a monic polynomial, the power sums can be computed recursively.Given the polynomial ( x^3 - x^2 + x - 2 = 0 ), the coefficients are ( a_3 = 1 ), ( a_2 = -1 ), ( a_1 = 1 ), ( a_0 = -2 ).Wait, Newton's identities relate the power sums ( S_k = p^k + q^k + r^k ) to the coefficients.The formula is:( S_k = (p + q + r) S_{k-1} - (pq + pr + qr) S_{k-2} + pqr S_{k-3} )For ( k geq 1 ), with ( S_0 = 3 ) (since there are three roots), ( S_{-1} = 0 ), etc.Wait, let me write down the recurrence.For ( k = 1 ):( S_1 = (p + q + r) S_0 - (pq + pr + qr) S_{-1} + pqr S_{-2} )But ( S_{-1} ) and ( S_{-2} ) are zero, so ( S_1 = (p + q + r) S_0 = 1 * 3 = 3 ). But actually, ( S_1 = p + q + r = 1 ). Hmm, maybe my understanding is off.Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the indices. Let me look up Newton's identities to make sure.Wait, since I can't actually look things up, I need to recall correctly.I think the correct formula is:( S_k = (p + q + r) S_{k-1} - (pq + pr + qr) S_{k-2} + pqr S_{k-3} )But for ( k geq 1 ), with ( S_0 = 3 ), ( S_{-1} = 0 ), ( S_{-2} = 0 ), etc.So, let's compute step by step.First, ( S_0 = 3 ) (since there are 3 roots).( S_1 = p + q + r = 1 )( S_2 = (p + q + r) S_1 - (pq + pr + qr) S_0 + pqr S_{-1} )But ( S_{-1} = 0 ), so:( S_2 = (1)(1) - (1)(3) + (2)(0) = 1 - 3 + 0 = -2 )Wait, but earlier, I found ( p^2 + q^2 + r^2 = -1 ). Hmm, now there's a discrepancy. Because ( S_2 = p^2 + q^2 + r^2 = -2 ) according to Newton's identities, but earlier I got -1.Wait, this is confusing. Which one is correct?Wait, let's recast.Using Vieta's, ( p^2 + q^2 + r^2 = (p + q + r)^2 - 2(pq + pr + qr) = 1 - 2(1) = -1 ). So, that's one result.But using Newton's identities, ( S_2 = -2 ). So, which one is correct?Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in applying Newton's identities.Wait, let's compute ( S_2 ) using Newton's formula.Given:- ( S_1 = 1 )- ( S_0 = 3 )- ( S_{-1} = 0 )So, ( S_2 = (p + q + r) S_1 - (pq + pr + qr) S_0 + pqr S_{-1} )Plugging in:( S_2 = (1)(1) - (1)(3) + (2)(0) = 1 - 3 + 0 = -2 )But according to Vieta's, ( p^2 + q^2 + r^2 = (1)^2 - 2(1) = -1 ). So, which one is correct?Wait, maybe I messed up the formula for Newton's identities. Let me think again.Wait, actually, I think the formula is slightly different. Maybe it's:( S_k = (p + q + r) S_{k-1} - (pq + pr + qr) S_{k-2} + pqr S_{k-3} )But for ( k = 2 ), this would be:( S_2 = (p + q + r) S_1 - (pq + pr + qr) S_0 + pqr S_{-1} )Which is:( S_2 = 1 * 1 - 1 * 3 + 2 * 0 = 1 - 3 + 0 = -2 )But according to Vieta's, ( p^2 + q^2 + r^2 = -1 ). So, which one is correct?Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial formula. Let me think.Wait, actually, ( S_2 = p^2 + q^2 + r^2 ), so according to Vieta's, it's -1, but according to Newton's identities, it's -2. There's a conflict here.Hmm, that suggests that either my application of Vieta's is wrong or my application of Newton's is wrong.Wait, let's compute ( S_2 ) directly from the equation.Since each root satisfies ( x^3 = x^2 - x + 2 ), so ( x^3 - x^2 + x - 2 = 0 ). So, ( x^3 = x^2 - x + 2 ).But ( S_2 = p^2 + q^2 + r^2 ). How does that relate to the equation?Alternatively, maybe I can express ( S_2 ) in terms of ( S_1 ) and the coefficients.Wait, another formula: ( S_2 = (p + q + r)^2 - 2(pq + pr + qr) ). So, that's ( 1^2 - 2(1) = 1 - 2 = -1 ). So, that's correct.But Newton's identities gave me -2. So, why the discrepancy?Wait, perhaps I misapplied Newton's identities. Let me check the formula again.Wait, maybe the formula is:( S_k = (p + q + r) S_{k-1} - (pq + pr + qr) S_{k-2} + pqr S_{k-3} )But for ( k = 2 ), this is:( S_2 = (p + q + r) S_1 - (pq + pr + qr) S_0 + pqr S_{-1} )But ( S_{-1} ) is not defined. Wait, perhaps ( S_{-1} ) is zero? Or maybe the formula is different.Wait, maybe the formula is only valid for ( k geq 1 ), and for ( k = 1 ), ( S_1 = (p + q + r) S_0 - (pq + pr + qr) S_{-1} + pqr S_{-2} ). But ( S_{-1} ) and ( S_{-2} ) are zero, so ( S_1 = (p + q + r) S_0 ). But ( S_0 = 3 ), so ( S_1 = 1 * 3 = 3 ). But that's not correct because ( S_1 = p + q + r = 1 ). So, that suggests that my formula is wrong.Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the formula. Maybe it's:( S_k = (p + q + r) S_{k-1} - (pq + pr + qr) S_{k-2} + pqr S_{k-3} )But for ( k = 1 ), we have:( S_1 = (p + q + r) S_0 - (pq + pr + qr) S_{-1} + pqr S_{-2} )But ( S_{-1} ) and ( S_{-2} ) are zero, so ( S_1 = (p + q + r) S_0 = 1 * 3 = 3 ). But that's not correct because ( S_1 = 1 ). So, clearly, my formula is wrong.Wait, perhaps the formula is different. Maybe the correct formula is:( S_k = (p + q + r) S_{k-1} - (pq + pr + qr) S_{k-2} + pqr S_{k-3} )But with the understanding that ( S_0 = 3 ), ( S_{-1} = 0 ), and ( S_{-2} = 0 ).But for ( k = 1 ):( S_1 = (1)(3) - (1)(0) + (2)(0) = 3 ). But ( S_1 = 1 ), so that's inconsistent.Wait, maybe the formula is:( S_k = (p + q + r) S_{k-1} - (pq + pr + qr) S_{k-2} + pqr S_{k-3} )But for ( k geq 3 ). So, for ( k = 1 ) and ( k = 2 ), it's different.Wait, perhaps I need to use a different approach for ( S_1 ) and ( S_2 ). Maybe ( S_1 ) is just ( p + q + r ), which is 1, and ( S_2 ) is ( (p + q + r)^2 - 2(pq + pr + qr) ), which is -1. Then, for ( k geq 3 ), we can use the recurrence.So, for ( k = 3 ):( S_3 = (p + q + r) S_2 - (pq + pr + qr) S_1 + pqr S_0 )Plugging in the known values:( S_3 = (1)(-1) - (1)(1) + (2)(3) = (-1) - 1 + 6 = 4 )So, ( S_3 = 4 ). Therefore, ( p^3 + q^3 + r^3 = 4 ). So, that's consistent with my earlier result.But since 4 isn't an option, the answer is (E) None of these.Wait, but let me check if I can compute ( S_3 ) another way. Since each root satisfies ( x^3 = x^2 - x + 2 ), so ( p^3 = p^2 - p + 2 ), same for q and r.Therefore, adding them up:( p^3 + q^3 + r^3 = (p^2 + q^2 + r^2) - (p + q + r) + 6 )We know ( p^2 + q^2 + r^2 = -1 ) and ( p + q + r = 1 ), so:( (-1) - 1 + 6 = 4 ). So, same result.Therefore, I think 4 is correct, so the answer is (E).But just to be thorough, let me see if I can find another way to compute ( S_3 ).Alternatively, using the original equation, ( x^3 = x^2 - x + 2 ). So, for each root, ( p^3 = p^2 - p + 2 ), so ( p^3 + q^3 + r^3 = (p^2 + q^2 + r^2) - (p + q + r) + 6 ). As above.We have ( p^2 + q^2 + r^2 = -1 ), so:( (-1) - 1 + 6 = 4 ). So, same result.Alternatively, maybe I can compute ( S_3 ) using the original equation.Wait, another approach: since the polynomial is ( x^3 - x^2 + x - 2 = 0 ), then ( x^3 = x^2 - x + 2 ). So, ( p^3 = p^2 - p + 2 ), same for q and r.Therefore, ( p^3 + q^3 + r^3 = (p^2 + q^2 + r^2) - (p + q + r) + 6 ). As above.So, ( p^2 + q^2 + r^2 = (p + q + r)^2 - 2(pq + pr + qr) = 1 - 2(1) = -1 ). So, ( p^3 + q^3 + r^3 = (-1) - 1 + 6 = 4 ).So, all methods point to 4.But the options are (A) -1, (B) 1, (C) 3, (D) 5, (E) None of these.Therefore, the correct answer is (E) None of these.But just to make sure, let me compute ( S_3 ) using the recurrence relation.Given:- ( S_0 = 3 )- ( S_1 = 1 )- ( S_2 = -1 ) (from Vieta's)- Then, ( S_3 = (p + q + r) S_2 - (pq + pr + qr) S_1 + pqr S_0 )Plugging in:( S_3 = (1)(-1) - (1)(1) + (2)(3) = -1 -1 + 6 = 4 )So, same result.Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 4, which isn't among the options, so (E) is the correct choice.**Final Answer**boxed{E}"},{"question":"Can the numbers 1, 2, cdots, 32 be arranged in a sequence such that the average of any two numbers is not equal to any number between them?Can the numbers 1, 2, cdots, 100 be arranged in a sequence such that the average of any two numbers is not equal to any number between them?","answer":"Alright, so I came across this interesting problem today. It asks whether the numbers from 1 to 32 can be arranged in a sequence such that the average of any two numbers isn't equal to any number that lies between them in the sequence. And then it extends the question to numbers from 1 to 100. Hmm, okay, let me try to wrap my head around this.First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. We need to arrange numbers 1 through 32 (and then 1 through 100) in a sequence. Let's denote this sequence as ( a_1, a_2, a_3, ldots, a_n ), where ( n ) is 32 or 100. The condition is that for any two numbers ( a_i ) and ( a_j ) where ( i < j ), the average ( frac{a_i + a_j}{2} ) should not be equal to any ( a_k ) where ( i < k < j ). So, essentially, between any two numbers in the sequence, their average shouldn't appear.This reminds me of something I might have heard before in math, maybe related to sequences without arithmetic progressions? Or perhaps it's about constructing a sequence where certain averages don't show up. Let me think.I recall that in combinatorics, there's a concept called a \\"no-three-term arithmetic progression\\" set, where no three elements form an arithmetic progression. That is, there are no three numbers ( a, b, c ) such that ( b - a = c - b ), or equivalently, ( b = frac{a + c}{2} ). So, in other words, such a set doesn't contain any three numbers where one is the average of the other two. Wait a second, so if we can arrange the numbers 1 through 32 (and 1 through 100) in a sequence where no three consecutive terms form an arithmetic progression, that might satisfy the condition. But actually, the problem is a bit different because it's not just about consecutive terms but any two terms with something in between. So, it's a stricter condition. It's not just about consecutive terms but any two terms with any number of terms in between. So, the average of any two terms shouldn't be present anywhere in between them in the sequence.Hmm, so maybe it's related to a concept called a \\"Sidon sequence\\" or something else? Wait, a Sidon sequence is about all pairwise sums being unique, which is a different condition. Maybe not that.Alternatively, maybe it's related to permutations avoiding certain patterns. I think in permutation patterns, we talk about avoiding specific sequences, but I'm not sure if this is exactly the same.Let me try to think of a smaller case first. Let's say n=3. Can we arrange 1,2,3 such that the average of any two isn't in between them? Let's see.Possible permutations:1,2,3: The average of 1 and 3 is 2, which is in between. So, that doesn't work.1,3,2: The average of 1 and 3 is 2, which is not in between because 2 is at the end. Wait, but in this case, between 1 and 3, we have nothing, right? Because 1 is first, 3 is second, and 2 is third. So, the average of 1 and 3 is 2, which is after them, not between. So, that might be okay.Wait, but hold on. The average of 1 and 2 is 1.5, which isn't an integer, so it's not in the sequence. The average of 3 and 2 is 2.5, which isn't in the sequence. So, in this case, 1,3,2 seems to satisfy the condition.Similarly, 2,1,3: The average of 2 and 1 is 1.5, not in the sequence. The average of 2 and 3 is 2.5, not in the sequence. The average of 1 and 3 is 2, which is before them, so it's not between. So, that also works.Wait, so for n=3, it's possible. Interesting.How about n=4? Let's try to arrange 1,2,3,4.Let me try 1,3,2,4.Check the averages:1 and 3: average is 2, which is in between? In the sequence, 1 is first, 3 is second, 2 is third. So, between 1 and 3, there's nothing. Then between 1 and 2, which are first and third, the average is 1.5, not in the sequence. Between 1 and 4, average is 2.5, not in the sequence. Between 3 and 2, average is 2.5, not in the sequence. Between 3 and 4, average is 3.5, not in the sequence. Between 2 and 4, average is 3, which is before them. So, 3 is before 2 and 4, so it's not between. So, seems okay.Wait, but hold on. Let me check all pairs:1 and 3: average 2, which is not between them because they are adjacent.1 and 2: average 1.5, not in the sequence.1 and 4: average 2.5, not in the sequence.3 and 2: average 2.5, not in the sequence.3 and 4: average 3.5, not in the sequence.2 and 4: average 3, which is before them, not between.So, yes, 1,3,2,4 works.Alternatively, another arrangement: 2,4,1,3.Check the averages:2 and 4: average 3, which is at the end, not between.2 and 1: average 1.5, not in the sequence.2 and 3: average 2.5, not in the sequence.4 and 1: average 2.5, not in the sequence.4 and 3: average 3.5, not in the sequence.1 and 3: average 2, which is before them, not between.So, that works too.So, for n=4, it's possible. Interesting.Wait, so maybe for any n, it's possible? But the question is specifically about n=32 and n=100. Maybe there's a pattern or a method to construct such a sequence.Let me think about how to construct such a sequence. Maybe using a recursive method or some kind of permutation where we alternate high and low numbers.Wait, another thought: if we arrange the numbers in such a way that they alternate between high and low, perhaps that would prevent the average of any two from being in between.For example, arranging them as 1, 32, 2, 31, 3, 30, ..., 16, 17. Let's see if that works.Wait, let's test this idea with n=4. If we arrange as 1,4,2,3.Check the averages:1 and 4: average 2.5, not in the sequence.1 and 2: average 1.5, not in the sequence.1 and 3: average 2, which is in the sequence but not between 1 and 3. Because in the sequence, 1 is first, 4 is second, 2 is third, 3 is fourth. So, between 1 and 3, we have 4 and 2. The average 2 is at position 3, which is between 1 (position 1) and 3 (position 4). Wait, so 2 is between 1 and 3 in the sequence, but the average of 1 and 3 is 2, which is in between. So, that violates the condition.Oh, so that arrangement doesn't work. Hmm, so maybe just alternating high and low isn't sufficient.Wait, let's try another arrangement for n=4: 2,4,1,3.As I checked earlier, that works. So, maybe arranging them in a specific order where high and low alternate but not strictly in pairs.Alternatively, maybe arranging the numbers in a way that the sequence is a \\"bitonic\\" sequence, first increasing then decreasing, but I don't know if that would help.Wait, another idea: perhaps using a permutation where each number is placed such that it's not the average of any two previous numbers. That sounds similar to constructing a sequence without arithmetic progressions, but I'm not sure.Wait, actually, in the problem, it's about the average of any two numbers not being present between them. So, it's a bit different because it's not just about three-term arithmetic progressions but any two numbers with their average in between them anywhere in the sequence.So, perhaps a more general concept. Maybe such a sequence is called a \\"sequence without midpoints\\" or something like that.I did a quick search in my mind, and I think this is related to the concept of a \\"midpoint-free\\" set or sequence. A set is midpoint-free if no two elements have their midpoint also in the set. But in this case, it's a sequence, and the condition is that the midpoint isn't between them in the sequence, not necessarily in the entire set.Wait, so it's a bit different. Because in the problem, the midpoint can be in the sequence, just not between the two numbers in question.So, for example, in the sequence 1,3,2,4, the midpoint of 1 and 3 is 2, which is after 3, so it's okay. The midpoint of 1 and 4 is 2.5, which isn't in the sequence. The midpoint of 3 and 2 is 2.5, which isn't in the sequence. The midpoint of 3 and 4 is 3.5, which isn't in the sequence. The midpoint of 2 and 4 is 3, which is before them, so it's okay.So, in this case, the midpoints that are in the sequence are either before or after the pair, but not in between. So, the condition is satisfied.So, perhaps such a sequence can be constructed by arranging the numbers in a specific order where midpoints are either before or after any pair.How can we construct such a sequence? Maybe using a recursive approach or some kind of ordering based on binary representations.Wait, another thought: Maybe arranging the numbers in an order where each number is as far as possible from the previous ones, preventing the average from landing in between.Alternatively, perhaps using a permutation where each number is placed in a position such that it doesn't create a midpoint with any previous pair.Wait, maybe using a greedy algorithm: Start with 1, then place the next number as far as possible, then the next, ensuring that no midpoint is created between any two numbers already placed.But I'm not sure how to formalize that.Wait, another idea: Maybe using a permutation where the sequence alternates between the smallest remaining and largest remaining numbers. Let's test this for n=4.Start with 1, then 4, then 2, then 3. Wait, that's the same as before, which didn't work because the average of 1 and 3 is 2, which is between them in the sequence.Hmm, so that approach might not work.Wait, maybe instead of alternating strictly, we can use a different strategy. For example, placing numbers in a way that high and low alternate but with some offset.Wait, let me think about the binary Gray code. Gray code is a binary numbering system where two successive values differ in only one bit. Not sure if that's related, but sometimes such codes have properties that might prevent certain averages.Alternatively, maybe arranging the numbers based on their binary representations, such that the sequence alternates in a way that avoids midpoints.Wait, another angle: Maybe using a permutation where the sequence is such that for any i < j < k, ( a_j neq frac{a_i + a_k}{2} ). That is, no three terms form an arithmetic progression, regardless of their positions. But actually, the problem is a bit different because it's not about three terms in arithmetic progression, but about any two terms not having their average present between them in the sequence.So, it's a different condition. For example, in the sequence 1,3,2,4, the terms 1,2,3 form an arithmetic progression, but in the sequence, 2 is not between 1 and 3; instead, 3 is between 1 and 2. So, the condition is satisfied because the average isn't between them in the sequence.Wait, so maybe the problem is about avoiding three-term arithmetic progressions in the sequence, but not necessarily in the set. Because in the set, you can have arithmetic progressions, but in the sequence, the middle term shouldn't be between the other two.So, perhaps it's a weaker condition than avoiding all three-term arithmetic progressions in the set. Because in the set, you can have arithmetic progressions, but in the sequence, their order is such that the middle term isn't between the other two.So, maybe such a permutation is possible for any n, but I'm not sure.Wait, let me think about the concept of a \\"permutation avoiding arithmetic progressions.\\" I think there's a concept called \\"anti-arithmetic permutations,\\" but I'm not sure about the exact terminology.Alternatively, maybe it's related to the Erd≈ës‚ÄìSzekeres theorem, which is about monotonic subsequences, but that might not be directly related.Wait, another idea: Maybe using a permutation where the sequence is constructed in such a way that the differences between consecutive terms are all distinct or follow a certain pattern that prevents midpoints from appearing.Wait, let me think about the Thue-Morse sequence. It's a sequence that avoids certain repetitions, but I'm not sure if it's related here.Alternatively, perhaps using a permutation where each number is placed in a position that's far enough from others to prevent their averages from landing in between.Wait, maybe arranging the numbers in a specific order, such as the order of a binary reflected Gray code. Let me try to see.For n=4, the Gray code sequence is 0,1,3,2 in binary, which corresponds to 1,2,4,3 in decimal. Wait, let's check if that works.Sequence: 1,2,4,3.Check the averages:1 and 2: average 1.5, not in the sequence.1 and 4: average 2.5, not in the sequence.1 and 3: average 2, which is in the sequence but not between 1 and 3. Because in the sequence, 1 is first, 2 is second, 4 is third, 3 is fourth. So, between 1 and 3, we have 2 and 4. The average 2 is at position 2, which is between 1 and 3 in the sequence. So, that violates the condition.So, that arrangement doesn't work either.Hmm, tricky.Wait, maybe another approach: Let's consider arranging the numbers in such a way that for any two numbers, their average is either less than the smaller one or greater than the larger one. But that's impossible because the average of two numbers is always between them.Wait, no, that's not the case. The average is always between the two numbers, but in the sequence, the average can be placed either before both, between them, or after both.So, if we can arrange the sequence such that for any two numbers, their average is either before both or after both, then the condition is satisfied.So, in other words, for any two numbers ( a_i ) and ( a_j ) with ( i < j ), the average ( frac{a_i + a_j}{2} ) should not be in the subsequence ( a_{i+1}, a_{i+2}, ldots, a_{j-1} ).So, how can we arrange the sequence to satisfy this?One possible way is to arrange the numbers in an order where each new number is either larger than all previous numbers or smaller than all previous numbers. That way, the average of any two numbers would either be larger than both or smaller than both, hence not between them in the sequence.Wait, that sounds promising. Let's see.If we arrange the sequence such that it's either entirely increasing or entirely decreasing, then the average of any two numbers would be between them in value, but since the sequence is monotonic, the average would not be present in the sequence at all. Wait, no, because the average might be another number in the sequence, but in a monotonic sequence, the average would lie between the two numbers in value, but since the sequence is increasing or decreasing, the average would be between them in position as well.Wait, no, actually, in a strictly increasing sequence, the average of any two numbers is not in the sequence unless it's another number. For example, in 1,2,3,4, the average of 1 and 3 is 2, which is in the sequence and between them. So, that violates the condition.Therefore, a strictly increasing or decreasing sequence won't work because it can contain averages of pairs within them.So, that approach doesn't work.Wait, another idea: Maybe arranging the sequence in such a way that it's a \\"zigzag\\" sequence, where it alternately increases and decreases, but in a controlled manner to prevent averages from landing in between.Wait, let's try constructing such a sequence for n=4.Start with 1, then go to 3, then to 2, then to 4.Check the averages:1 and 3: average 2, which is after 3, so it's okay.1 and 2: average 1.5, not in the sequence.1 and 4: average 2.5, not in the sequence.3 and 2: average 2.5, not in the sequence.3 and 4: average 3.5, not in the sequence.2 and 4: average 3, which is before them, so it's okay.So, this works. So, the sequence 1,3,2,4 works.Similarly, for n=5, can we extend this?Let's try 1,3,2,4,5.Check the averages:1 and 3: average 2, which is after 3, okay.1 and 2: average 1.5, not in the sequence.1 and 4: average 2.5, not in the sequence.1 and 5: average 3, which is before them, okay.3 and 2: average 2.5, not in the sequence.3 and 4: average 3.5, not in the sequence.3 and 5: average 4, which is before them, okay.2 and 4: average 3, which is before them, okay.2 and 5: average 3.5, not in the sequence.4 and 5: average 4.5, not in the sequence.So, that works.Wait, so maybe we can construct such a sequence by starting with 1, then the next highest number, then the next lowest, then the next highest, and so on.So, for n=5: 1,3,2,4,5.Similarly, for n=6: 1,3,2,4,6,5.Let's check n=6.Sequence: 1,3,2,4,6,5.Check the averages:1 and 3: average 2, which is after 3, okay.1 and 2: average 1.5, not in the sequence.1 and 4: average 2.5, not in the sequence.1 and 6: average 3.5, not in the sequence.1 and 5: average 3, which is before them, okay.3 and 2: average 2.5, not in the sequence.3 and 4: average 3.5, not in the sequence.3 and 6: average 4.5, not in the sequence.3 and 5: average 4, which is before them, okay.2 and 4: average 3, which is before them, okay.2 and 6: average 4, which is before them, okay.2 and 5: average 3.5, not in the sequence.4 and 6: average 5, which is after them, okay.4 and 5: average 4.5, not in the sequence.6 and 5: average 5.5, not in the sequence.So, that works as well.So, it seems like arranging the sequence by starting with 1, then the next highest, then the next lowest, then the next highest, etc., we can construct such a sequence.So, for n=32, we can arrange the numbers in this way: 1,32,2,31,3,30,...,16,17.Wait, let me test this for n=4.Wait, n=4: 1,4,2,3.But earlier, we saw that this arrangement doesn't work because the average of 1 and 3 is 2, which is between them in the sequence.Wait, so maybe my initial thought was wrong. Let me check.Wait, in the sequence 1,4,2,3:- The average of 1 and 4 is 2.5, not in the sequence.- The average of 1 and 2 is 1.5, not in the sequence.- The average of 1 and 3 is 2, which is in the sequence. In the sequence, 1 is first, 4 is second, 2 is third, 3 is fourth. So, between 1 and 3, we have 4 and 2. The average 2 is at position 3, which is between 1 (position 1) and 3 (position 4). So, that violates the condition.Therefore, this arrangement doesn't work for n=4.Wait, but earlier, when I arranged n=4 as 1,3,2,4, it worked. So, maybe the way I alternate is different.Wait, in the previous successful arrangement for n=4, I alternated starting with 1, then 3 (which is the second highest), then 2 (which is the next lowest), then 4 (which is the highest). So, the order was 1,3,2,4.Similarly, for n=5, it was 1,3,2,4,5.So, perhaps the correct way is to alternate between the next highest and the next lowest, but starting with 1, then the second highest, then the next lowest, then the next highest, etc.Wait, let me try to formalize this.Let me denote the sequence as follows:Start with 1.Then take the next highest number, which is 32.Then take the next lowest number, which is 2.Then take the next highest number, which is 31.Then take the next lowest number, which is 3.And so on, until all numbers are placed.So, for n=32, the sequence would be:1,32,2,31,3,30,4,29,...,16,17.Wait, let's check if this works for n=4.Sequence: 1,4,2,3.But as we saw earlier, this doesn't work because the average of 1 and 3 is 2, which is between them in the sequence.Wait, so maybe this approach doesn't work.Wait, but when I did n=4 as 1,3,2,4, it worked. So, perhaps the correct way is to alternate between the next highest and the next lowest, but not starting with the highest.Wait, let me try for n=4:Start with 1.Next, take the next highest, which is 3.Then, take the next lowest, which is 2.Then, take the next highest, which is 4.So, sequence: 1,3,2,4.Which works.Similarly, for n=5:1,3,2,4,5.Which works.For n=6:1,3,2,4,6,5.Which works.So, the pattern is: Start with 1, then the second highest, then the next lowest, then the next highest, etc.Wait, so for n=32, the sequence would be:1,31,2,30,3,29,4,28,...,16,17.Wait, let me check for n=4:1,31,2,30,... Wait, no, for n=4, it's 1,3,2,4.Wait, perhaps the general formula is: Start with 1, then n-1, then 2, then n-2, then 3, then n-3, etc.So, for n=4: 1,3,2,4.For n=5: 1,4,2,5,3.Wait, let me check n=5:Sequence: 1,4,2,5,3.Check the averages:1 and 4: average 2.5, not in the sequence.1 and 2: average 1.5, not in the sequence.1 and 5: average 3, which is at the end, okay.1 and 3: average 2, which is in the sequence. In the sequence, 1 is first, 4 is second, 2 is third, 5 is fourth, 3 is fifth. So, between 1 and 3, we have 4,2,5. The average 2 is at position 3, which is between 1 and 3. So, that violates the condition.So, that arrangement doesn't work.Wait, so maybe my initial approach was wrong.Wait, perhaps the correct way is to alternate between the next highest and the next lowest, but not starting with the highest.Wait, for n=4, starting with 1, then 3, then 2, then 4 works.Similarly, for n=5, starting with 1, then 3, then 2, then 4, then 5 works.Wait, but when I tried n=5 as 1,3,2,4,5, it worked.Wait, let me check n=5:Sequence: 1,3,2,4,5.Check the averages:1 and 3: average 2, which is after 3, okay.1 and 2: average 1.5, not in the sequence.1 and 4: average 2.5, not in the sequence.1 and 5: average 3, which is before them, okay.3 and 2: average 2.5, not in the sequence.3 and 4: average 3.5, not in the sequence.3 and 5: average 4, which is before them, okay.2 and 4: average 3, which is before them, okay.2 and 5: average 3.5, not in the sequence.4 and 5: average 4.5, not in the sequence.So, that works.Wait, so for n=5, arranging as 1,3,2,4,5 works.Similarly, for n=6, arranging as 1,3,2,4,6,5 works.Wait, so maybe the pattern is to interleave the lower half and the upper half, starting with 1, then the second highest, then 2, then the second lowest, etc.Wait, no, in n=4, it's 1,3,2,4.Which is 1, (n-1), 2, n.Similarly, for n=5: 1,3,2,4,5.Which is 1, (n-2), 2, (n-1), n.Wait, maybe the general formula is:Start with 1.Then take the number at position (n - (k)), where k is the step.Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of dividing the numbers into two halves: lower half and upper half.For even n=32, lower half is 1-16, upper half is 17-32.Then, interleave them as 1,32,2,31,3,30,...,16,17.Wait, let's test this for n=4:Lower half: 1,2; upper half: 3,4.Interleave: 1,4,2,3.But as we saw earlier, this doesn't work because the average of 1 and 3 is 2, which is between them.Wait, so maybe this approach doesn't work.Wait, but when we arranged n=4 as 1,3,2,4, it worked. So, perhaps the correct way is to interleave the lower half and the upper half, but starting with the lower half, then the upper half minus one, then the next lower, then upper minus two, etc.Wait, for n=4:Lower half: 1,2.Upper half: 3,4.Interleave as 1,3,2,4.Which works.Similarly, for n=5:Lower half:1,2.Upper half:3,4,5.Interleave as 1,3,2,4,5.Which works.For n=6:Lower half:1,2,3.Upper half:4,5,6.Interleave as 1,4,2,5,3,6.Wait, let's check this sequence:1,4,2,5,3,6.Check the averages:1 and 4: average 2.5, not in the sequence.1 and 2: average 1.5, not in the sequence.1 and 5: average 3, which is in the sequence. In the sequence, 1 is first, 4 is second, 2 is third, 5 is fourth, 3 is fifth, 6 is sixth. So, between 1 and 3, we have 4,2,5. The average 3 is at position 5, which is after 5, so it's okay.Wait, but the average of 1 and 5 is 3, which is in the sequence, but it's after 5, so it's okay.Similarly, check other pairs:1 and 3: average 2, which is in the sequence. In the sequence, 1 is first, 4 is second, 2 is third, 5 is fourth, 3 is fifth, 6 is sixth. So, between 1 and 3, we have 4,2,5. The average 2 is at position 3, which is between 1 and 3. So, that violates the condition.Ah, so that arrangement doesn't work.Wait, so maybe interleaving lower and upper halves in this way doesn't work for even n.Wait, but for n=4, when we interleaved as 1,3,2,4, it worked. So, perhaps the correct way is to interleave lower and upper halves, but not in a strict 1, upper, 2, upper-1, etc., but in a different way.Wait, maybe for n=6, we can arrange as 1,4,2,5,3,6, but we saw that the average of 1 and 3 is 2, which is between them. So, that doesn't work.Wait, another idea: Maybe arrange the sequence in such a way that the lower half is arranged in increasing order, and the upper half is arranged in decreasing order, and then interleave them.Wait, for n=4:Lower half:1,2.Upper half:4,3.Interleave:1,4,2,3.But as before, the average of 1 and 3 is 2, which is between them.Wait, doesn't work.Wait, maybe arrange the lower half in increasing order and the upper half in increasing order, but interleave them in a way that alternates between lower and upper.Wait, for n=4:1,3,2,4.Which works.Similarly, for n=5:1,3,2,4,5.Which works.For n=6:1,3,2,4,6,5.Let me check this sequence:1,3,2,4,6,5.Check the averages:1 and 3: average 2, which is after 3, okay.1 and 2: average 1.5, not in the sequence.1 and 4: average 2.5, not in the sequence.1 and 6: average 3.5, not in the sequence.1 and 5: average 3, which is before them, okay.3 and 2: average 2.5, not in the sequence.3 and 4: average 3.5, not in the sequence.3 and 6: average 4.5, not in the sequence.3 and 5: average 4, which is before them, okay.2 and 4: average 3, which is before them, okay.2 and 6: average 4, which is before them, okay.2 and 5: average 3.5, not in the sequence.4 and 6: average 5, which is after them, okay.4 and 5: average 4.5, not in the sequence.6 and 5: average 5.5, not in the sequence.So, that works.So, for n=6, arranging as 1,3,2,4,6,5 works.So, the pattern seems to be: Start with 1, then the next odd number, then the next even number, then the next odd, etc., but I'm not sure.Wait, let me see:For n=4:1,3,2,4.For n=5:1,3,2,4,5.For n=6:1,3,2,4,6,5.So, the pattern is: Start with 1, then 3, then 2, then 4, then 6, then 5, etc.So, it's like interleaving the lower half and upper half, but starting with the lower half's first element, then the upper half's first element, then the lower half's second element, then the upper half's second element, etc.Wait, for n=6:Lower half:1,2,3.Upper half:4,5,6.Interleave as 1,4,2,5,3,6.But that didn't work because the average of 1 and 3 is 2, which is between them.Wait, but in the working sequence, it's 1,3,2,4,6,5.So, it's interleaving lower and upper, but not in the strict order.Wait, perhaps it's better to think of it as arranging the sequence by taking the smallest remaining, then the largest remaining, then the next smallest, then the next largest, etc.Wait, let's try that for n=4:Start with 1.Then take the largest remaining:4.Then take the next smallest:2.Then take the next largest:3.Sequence:1,4,2,3.But as before, the average of 1 and 3 is 2, which is between them.So, that doesn't work.Wait, but when we did 1,3,2,4, it worked. So, maybe the correct way is to take the smallest, then the second largest, then the next smallest, then the second smallest, etc.Wait, for n=4:1,3,2,4.Which is:1, (n-1),2,n.Similarly, for n=5:1,4,2,5,3.Which is:1, (n-1),2,n,3.Wait, let me check n=5:Sequence:1,4,2,5,3.Check the averages:1 and 4: average 2.5, not in the sequence.1 and 2: average 1.5, not in the sequence.1 and 5: average 3, which is at the end, okay.1 and 3: average 2, which is in the sequence. In the sequence, 1 is first,4 is second,2 is third,5 is fourth,3 is fifth. So, between 1 and 3, we have 4,2,5. The average 2 is at position 3, which is between 1 and 3. So, that violates the condition.So, that arrangement doesn't work.Wait, so maybe the correct way is to alternate between the lower half and the upper half, but not in a strict order.Wait, perhaps another approach: Let's consider arranging the numbers in such a way that the sequence is a \\"Salem-Spencer\\" set, which is a set with no three-term arithmetic progression. But in this case, it's a sequence, not a set, and the condition is slightly different.Wait, but if we can arrange the numbers in a sequence that's also a Salem-Spencer set, then it would satisfy the condition because there are no three-term arithmetic progressions, meaning no three numbers where the middle one is the average of the other two. But in our problem, the condition is slightly different because it's about the average not being between two numbers in the sequence, not necessarily about three-term arithmetic progressions in the set.Wait, but if the sequence is a Salem-Spencer set, then it would satisfy our condition because there are no three-term arithmetic progressions, so the average of any two numbers isn't present in the set, hence not between them in the sequence.Wait, but Salem-Spencer sets are about sets, not sequences. So, arranging them in any order would still be a set with no three-term arithmetic progression, but in the sequence, the order matters.Wait, perhaps if we arrange the numbers in a sequence that's also a Salem-Spencer set, then it would satisfy our condition.But I'm not sure if such a permutation exists for all n.Wait, another thought: Maybe using a permutation where the sequence is constructed by recursively splitting the set into two halves and interleaving them in a specific way.Wait, for example, for n=4:Split into [1,2] and [3,4].Interleave as 1,3,2,4.Which works.Similarly, for n=8:Split into [1,2,3,4] and [5,6,7,8].Interleave as 1,5,2,6,3,7,4,8.Wait, let's check this sequence:1,5,2,6,3,7,4,8.Check the averages:1 and 5: average 3, which is in the sequence. In the sequence, 1 is first,5 is second,2 is third,6 is fourth,3 is fifth,7 is sixth,4 is seventh,8 is eighth. So, between 1 and 3, we have 5,2,6. The average 3 is at position 5, which is after 6, so it's okay.Wait, but the average of 1 and 3 is 2, which is in the sequence. In the sequence, 1 is first,5 is second,2 is third,6 is fourth,3 is fifth,7 is sixth,4 is seventh,8 is eighth. So, between 1 and 3, we have 5,2,6. The average 2 is at position 3, which is between 1 and 3. So, that violates the condition.So, that arrangement doesn't work.Wait, so maybe interleaving the two halves doesn't work for larger n.Wait, perhaps another approach: Let's consider arranging the numbers in a specific order where each number is placed such that it's not the average of any two previous numbers.Wait, but that might be too restrictive because as we add numbers, we have to ensure that none of the new averages are present between any two previous numbers.Wait, maybe using a greedy algorithm: Start with 1, then add the next number such that it doesn't create a forbidden average with any previous pair.But this might get complicated.Wait, another idea: Maybe using a permutation where the sequence is a \\"bit-reversed\\" order. For example, for n=8, the bit-reversed order is 1,4,2,5,3,6,7,8. Wait, let me check.Wait, actually, bit-reversed order for n=8 would be:000 -> 000 -> 0001 -> 100 -> 4010 -> 010 -> 2011 -> 101 -> 5100 -> 001 -> 1101 -> 011 -> 3110 -> 110 -> 6111 -> 111 ->7Wait, so the sequence would be 0,4,2,5,1,3,6,7.But since we're dealing with numbers 1-8, it would be 1,5,3,6,2,4,7,8.Wait, let me check this sequence:1,5,3,6,2,4,7,8.Check the averages:1 and 5: average 3, which is in the sequence. In the sequence, 1 is first,5 is second,3 is third,6 is fourth,2 is fifth,4 is sixth,7 is seventh,8 is eighth. So, between 1 and 3, we have 5. The average 3 is at position 3, which is after 5, so it's okay.Wait, but the average of 1 and 3 is 2, which is in the sequence. In the sequence, 1 is first,5 is second,3 is third,6 is fourth,2 is fifth,4 is sixth,7 is seventh,8 is eighth. So, between 1 and 2, we have 5,3,6. The average 2 is at position 5, which is after 6, so it's okay.Wait, but the average of 1 and 2 is 1.5, not in the sequence.Wait, the average of 5 and 3 is 4, which is in the sequence. In the sequence, 5 is second,3 is third,6 is fourth,2 is fifth,4 is sixth. So, between 5 and 4, we have 3,6,2. The average 4 is at position 6, which is after 2, so it's okay.Wait, the average of 5 and 6 is 5.5, not in the sequence.The average of 5 and 2 is 3.5, not in the sequence.The average of 5 and 4 is 4.5, not in the sequence.The average of 3 and 6 is 4.5, not in the sequence.The average of 3 and 2 is 2.5, not in the sequence.The average of 3 and 4 is 3.5, not in the sequence.The average of 6 and 2 is 4, which is in the sequence. In the sequence, 6 is fourth,2 is fifth,4 is sixth. So, between 6 and 4, we have 2. The average 4 is at position 6, which is after 2, so it's okay.The average of 6 and 4 is 5, which is before them, okay.The average of 2 and 4 is 3, which is before them, okay.The average of 2 and 7 is 4.5, not in the sequence.The average of 2 and 8 is 5, which is before them, okay.The average of 4 and 7 is 5.5, not in the sequence.The average of 4 and 8 is 6, which is before them, okay.The average of 7 and 8 is 7.5, not in the sequence.So, it seems like this arrangement works.Wait, so maybe arranging the numbers in bit-reversed order works for n=8.But I'm not sure if this generalizes to all n.Wait, let me try n=4 with bit-reversed order.For n=4, the bit-reversed order would be:00 -> 00 -> 001 -> 10 -> 210 -> 01 -> 111 -> 11 ->3So, the sequence would be 0,2,1,3.But since we're dealing with 1-4, it would be 1,3,2,4.Which works, as we saw earlier.So, for n=4, bit-reversed order gives us a valid sequence.Similarly, for n=8, it works.So, maybe this is a general solution.Wait, so if we arrange the numbers 1 to n in bit-reversed order, then the sequence satisfies the condition that the average of any two numbers isn't present between them in the sequence.But I need to verify this.Wait, bit-reversed order is a specific permutation where the position of each number is determined by reversing the bits of its binary representation.For example, for n=8, the numbers 0-7 in binary are:0: 0001: 0012: 0103: 0114: 1005: 1016: 1107: 111Reversing the bits:0: 000 -> 000 -> 01: 001 -> 100 ->42: 010 -> 010 ->23: 011 -> 101 ->54: 100 -> 001 ->15: 101 -> 101 ->5? Wait, no, reversing 101 gives 101, which is 5.Wait, no, reversing the bits of 5 (101) gives 101, which is still 5.Wait, but in the earlier example for n=8, the sequence was 1,5,3,6,2,4,7,8.Wait, maybe I'm missing something.Wait, perhaps I should consider 1-based indexing instead of 0-based.Wait, for n=8, numbers 1-8 in binary:1: 0012: 0103: 0114: 1005: 1016: 1107: 1118: 1000But reversing the bits for 8 would require 4 bits, so 8 is 1000, reversed is 0001, which is 1.Wait, but that would make the sequence start with 1, but 8 would be placed at position 1, which is conflicting.Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.Alternatively, perhaps using the bit-reversed order for n=8 as 1,5,3,7,2,6,4,8.Wait, let me check this sequence:1,5,3,7,2,6,4,8.Check the averages:1 and 5: average 3, which is in the sequence. In the sequence, 1 is first,5 is second,3 is third,7 is fourth,2 is fifth,6 is sixth,4 is seventh,8 is eighth. So, between 1 and 3, we have 5. The average 3 is at position 3, which is after 5, so it's okay.1 and 3: average 2, which is in the sequence. In the sequence, 1 is first,5 is second,3 is third,7 is fourth,2 is fifth,6 is sixth,4 is seventh,8 is eighth. So, between 1 and 2, we have 5,3,7.

In the sequence, 1 is first,5 is second,3 is third,7 is fourth,2 is fifth,6 is sixth,4 is seventh,8 is eighth. So, between 1 and 4, we have 5,3,7,2,6. The average 4 is at position 7, which is after 6, so it's okay.1 and 2: average 1.5, not in the sequence.1 and 6: average 3.5, not in the sequence.1 and 4: average 2.5, not in the sequence.1 and 8: average 4.5, not in the sequence.5 and 3: average 4, which is in the sequence. In the sequence, 5 is second,3 is third,7 is fourth,2 is fifth,6 is sixth,4 is seventh,8 is eighth. So, between 5 and 4, we have 3,7,2,6. The average 4 is at position 7, which is after 6, so it's okay.5 and 7: average 6, which is in the sequence. In the sequence, 5 is second,3 is third,7 is fourth,2 is fifth,6 is sixth,4 is seventh,8 is eighth. So, between 5 and 6, we have 3,7,2.

In the sequence, 2 is fifth,6 is sixth,4 is seventh,8 is eighth. So, between 2 and 4, we have 6. The average 4 is at position 7, which is after 6, so it's okay.2 and 4: average 3, which is before them, okay.2 and 8: average 5, which is before them, okay.6 and 4: average 5, which is before them, okay.6 and 8: average 7, which is before them, okay.4 and 8: average 6, which is before them, okay.So, this sequence seems to satisfy the condition.Therefore, arranging the numbers in bit-reversed order might be a way to construct such a sequence.But does this work for all n?Wait, for n=3:Bit-reversed order would be:1: 01 -> reverse ->10 -> 22:10 -> reverse ->01 ->13:11 -> reverse ->11 ->3But since n=3, we have to adjust.Wait, maybe it's better to think of n as a power of 2, but for n=32 and n=100, which are not powers of 2, this might not directly apply.Wait, but perhaps we can extend the idea.Wait, for n=32, which is a power of 2, arranging the numbers in bit-reversed order would work.Similarly, for n=100, which is not a power of 2, perhaps we can use a similar approach, but I'm not sure.Wait, but the problem is asking about n=32 and n=100, so maybe for n=32, which is a power of 2, arranging in bit-reversed order works, but for n=100, which isn't, we might need a different approach.Wait, but I'm not sure if bit-reversed order is the only way or if there's a more general method.Wait, another thought: Maybe using a permutation where the sequence is constructed by recursively splitting the set into two halves and interleaving them in a specific way, similar to the bit-reversed order.For example, for n=8:Split into [1,2,3,4] and [5,6,7,8].Interleave as 1,5,2,6,3,7,4,8.But as we saw earlier, this doesn't work because the average of 1 and 3 is 2, which is between them.Wait, but if we interleave as 1,3,5,7,2,4,6,8, does that work?Let me check:Sequence:1,3,5,7,2,4,6,8.Check the averages:1 and 3: average 2, which is in the sequence. In the sequence, 1 is first,3 is second,5 is third,7 is fourth,2 is fifth,4 is sixth,6 is seventh,8 is eighth. So, between 1 and 2, we have 3,5,7. The average 2 is at position 5, which is after 7, so it's okay.1 and 5: average 3, which is in the sequence. In the sequence, 1 is first,3 is second,5 is third,7 is fourth,2 is fifth,4 is sixth,6 is seventh,8 is eighth. So, between 1 and 3, we have nothing. The average 3 is at position 2, which is after 1, so it's okay.Wait, but the average of 1 and 5 is 3, which is in the sequence. In the sequence, 1 is first,3 is second,5 is third,7 is fourth,2 is fifth,4 is sixth,6 is seventh,8 is eighth. So, between 1 and 5, we have 3. The average 3 is at position 2, which is between 1 and 5. So, that violates the condition.So, that arrangement doesn't work.Wait, so maybe interleaving the lower and upper halves in a different way.Wait, perhaps arranging the sequence as 1,3,2,5,4,7,6,8.Let me check:Sequence:1,3,2,5,4,7,6,8.Check the averages:1 and 3: average 2, which is in the sequence. In the sequence, 1 is first,3 is second,2 is third,5 is fourth,4 is fifth,7 is sixth,6 is seventh,8 is eighth. So, between 1 and 2, we have 3.

before them, okay.So, this sequence seems to satisfy the condition.Therefore, arranging the numbers in a specific interleaved order, starting with the lower half and upper half, but in a way that alternates between lower and upper, seems to work.So, perhaps for n=32, arranging the numbers in such a way would work.But how?Wait, for n=8, we arranged as 1,3,2,5,4,7,6,8.Which is:1,3,2,5,4,7,6,8.So, it's like taking the lower half and upper half, and interleaving them as lower, upper, lower, upper, etc., but in a specific order.Wait, for n=8:Lower half:1,2,3,4.Upper half:5,6,7,8.Interleave as 1,3,2,5,4,7,6,8.Which is:1, (lower+1),2, (upper+1),4, (upper+3),6,8.Wait, not sure.Alternatively, it's like taking the lower half and arranging them as 1,3,2,4, and the upper half as 5,7,6,8, then interleaving them.Wait, maybe that's a way.So, for n=32, we can split the numbers into lower half:1-16 and upper half:17-32.Then, arrange the lower half as 1,3,2,5,4,7,6,...,15,16.Similarly, arrange the upper half as 17,19,18,21,20,23,22,...,31,32.Then, interleave them as 1,17,3,19,2,18,5,21,4,20,7,23,6,22,...,15,31,16,32.Wait, let me check if this works for n=8.Lower half arranged as 1,3,2,4.Upper half arranged as 5,7,6,8.Interleave as 1,5,3,7,2,6,4,8.Wait, but earlier, this arrangement didn't work because the average of 1 and 3 is 2, which is between them.Wait, but when we arranged as 1,3,2,5,4,7,6,8, it worked.So, perhaps the correct way is to interleave the lower half and upper half after arranging each half in a specific order.Wait, for n=8, arranging lower half as 1,3,2,4 and upper half as 5,7,6,8, then interleaving as 1,5,3,7,2,6,4,8 doesn't work, but arranging as 1,3,2,5,4,7,6,8 works.So, perhaps the correct way is to interleave the lower half and upper half in a specific order, not just strictly interleaving.Wait, maybe the correct way is to arrange the lower half and upper half each in the same specific order, then interleave them.Wait, for n=8, arranging lower half as 1,3,2,4 and upper half as 5,7,6,8, then interleaving as 1,5,3,7,2,6,4,8 doesn't work.But arranging as 1,3,2,5,4,7,6,8 works.So, perhaps the correct way is to interleave the lower half and upper half in a way that alternates between lower and upper, but not in a strict 1, upper, 2, upper, etc., but in a way that after placing a lower number, we place the corresponding upper number, then the next lower, then the next upper, etc.Wait, for n=8:Start with 1 (lower), then 5 (upper), then 3 (lower), then 7 (upper), then 2 (lower), then 6 (upper), then 4 (lower), then 8 (upper).But this sequence:1,5,3,7,2,6,4,8 doesn't work because the average of 1 and 3 is 2, which is between them.Wait, but when we arranged as 1,3,2,5,4,7,6,8, it worked.So, perhaps the correct way is to arrange the lower half in a specific order, then interleave with the upper half in a specific order.Wait, for n=8:Lower half arranged as 1,3,2,4.Upper half arranged as 5,7,6,8.Interleave as 1,3,2,5,4,7,6,8.Which works.So, the pattern is: Take the lower half arranged as 1,3,2,4, then the upper half arranged as 5,7,6,8, and interleave them as 1,3,2,5,4,7,6,8.Wait, so it's like taking the lower half and upper half each arranged in the same specific order, then interleaving them in a way that alternates between lower and upper, but not strictly in pairs.Wait, maybe the correct way is to arrange the lower half and upper half each in the same specific order, then interleave them in a way that alternates between lower and upper, but not in a strict 1, upper, 2, upper, etc., but in a way that after placing a lower number, we place the corresponding upper number, then the next lower, then the next upper, etc.Wait, but in the working example for n=8, it's 1,3,2,5,4,7,6,8.So, it's like taking the lower half arranged as 1,3,2,4 and the upper half arranged as 5,7,6,8, then interleaving them as 1,3,2,5,4,7,6,8.Wait, so it's like taking the lower half and upper half each arranged in a specific order, then interleaving them in a specific way.But I'm not sure how to generalize this.Wait, perhaps the key is to arrange each half in a way that within each half, the sequence satisfies the condition, and then interleave them in a way that the overall sequence also satisfies the condition.Wait, for n=8, lower half arranged as 1,3,2,4 satisfies the condition within itself, and upper half arranged as 5,7,6,8 also satisfies the condition within itself.Then, interleaving them as 1,3,2,5,4,7,6,8 satisfies the condition overall.So, perhaps for larger n, we can recursively apply this method.For example, for n=32, split into lower half 1-16 and upper half 17-32.Arrange each half in the same way, then interleave them.So, arrange lower half as 1,3,2,5,4,7,6,...,15,16.Arrange upper half as 17,19,18,21,20,23,22,...,31,32.Then interleave them as 1,17,3,19,2,18,5,21,4,20,7,23,6,22,...,15,31,16,32.Wait, let me check if this works for n=8.Lower half arranged as 1,3,2,4.Upper half arranged as 5,7,6,8.Interleave as 1,5,3,7,2,6,4,8.But as before, this arrangement doesn't work because the average of 1 and 3 is 2, which is between them.Wait, but when we arranged as 1,3,2,5,4,7,6,8, it worked.So, perhaps the correct way is to interleave the lower half and upper half in a different way.Wait, maybe after arranging each half, we interleave them by taking one from the lower half, one from the upper half, but in a specific order.Wait, for n=8, arranging lower half as 1,3,2,4 and upper half as 5,7,6,8, then interleave as 1,3,2,5,4,7,6,8.So, it's like taking the lower half and upper half each arranged in a specific order, then interleaving them in a way that alternates between lower and upper, but not in a strict 1, upper, 2, upper, etc., but in a way that after placing a lower number, we place the corresponding upper number, then the next lower, then the next upper, etc.Wait, but in the working example, it's 1,3,2,5,4,7,6,8.So, it's like taking the lower half arranged as 1,3,2,4 and the upper half arranged as 5,7,6,8, then interleaving them as 1,3,2,5,4,7,6,8.So, it's like taking the lower half and upper half each arranged in a specific order, then interleaving them in a specific way.But I'm not sure how to generalize this.Wait, perhaps the key is to arrange each half in a way that within each half, the sequence satisfies the condition, and then interleave them in a way that the overall sequence also satisfies the condition.So, for n=32, if we can arrange the lower half and upper half each in a way that satisfies the condition, then interleave them appropriately, the overall sequence would satisfy the condition.But I'm not sure.Wait, another idea: Maybe using a permutation where each number is placed such that it's not the midpoint of any two previous numbers.Wait, but this might be too restrictive.Wait, perhaps using a permutation where the sequence is constructed by recursively splitting the set into two halves and interleaving them in a specific way, similar to the bit-reversed order.Wait, for n=32, which is a power of 2, arranging the numbers in bit-reversed order would work.Similarly, for n=100, which isn't a power of 2, perhaps we can use a similar approach, but I'm not sure.Wait, but the problem is asking about n=32 and n=100, so maybe for n=32, arranging in bit-reversed order works, and for n=100, we can use a similar approach.But I'm not sure.Wait, another thought: Maybe using a permutation where the sequence is a \\"Gray code\\" order, where each successive number differs by one bit, but I'm not sure if that helps.Wait, perhaps another approach: Let's consider that for any two numbers, their average is either less than the smaller one or greater than the larger one, but that's impossible because the average is always between them.Wait, but in the sequence, the average can be placed either before both, between them, or after both.So, to satisfy the condition, we need to arrange the sequence such that for any two numbers, their average is either before both or after both.So, how can we arrange the sequence to achieve this?Wait, perhaps arranging the sequence in such a way that it's a \\"monotonic\\" sequence, but not strictly increasing or decreasing.Wait, no, because in a monotonic sequence, the average of two numbers would be between them in value, but in the sequence, it might be placed either before or after.Wait, but in a strictly increasing sequence, the average of two numbers is between them in value, but in the sequence, it's placed between them, which violates the condition.Wait, so maybe arranging the sequence in a way that it's not strictly increasing or decreasing, but alternates in a way that the average is either before or after.Wait, perhaps arranging the sequence as a \\"shuffle\\" of two increasing sequences, one for the lower half and one for the upper half, but in a specific order.Wait, for example, for n=8:Arrange lower half as 1,3,2,4 and upper half as 5,7,6,8, then interleave them as 1,3,2,5,4,7,6,8.Which works.So, perhaps for n=32, we can arrange the lower half and upper half each in the same specific order, then interleave them in a specific way.So, the answer is yes, such a sequence exists for both n=32 and n=100.Therefore, the answer is:For both 32 and 100, it's possible.So, the final answer is:For the first question: boxed{Yes}For the second question: boxed{Yes}"},{"question":"At the wildlife reserve, there were 15 wolves, 20 bears, and a certain number

If the number of mountain lions was one-third of the total number of wolves and bears combined, what was the total number of large mammals at the wildlife reserve?","answer":"First, I need to find the number of mountain lions. The problem states that the number of mountain lions is one-third of the total number of wolves and bears combined.There are 15 wolves and 20 bears, so the total number of wolves and bears is 15 + 20 = 35.One-third of 35 is 35 divided by 3, which equals approximately 11.6667. Since the number of animals must be a whole number, I'll round this to 12 mountain lions.Next, I'll calculate the total number of large mammals by adding the number of wolves, bears, and mountain lions together: 15 + 20 + 12 = 47.Therefore, the total number of large mammals at the wildlife reserve is 47."},{"question":"Ricardo needs to buy fabric to cut into 8 pieces that are each 3 feet long.
